The real-time simulation of rigid-bodies subjected to forces and contacts is the main feature of a physics engine for
video-games, robotics, or animation. Rigid-bodies are typically used to simulate the dynamics of non-deformable solids as well
as to integrate the trajectory of solids which velocities are controlled by the user (e.g. moving platforms). On
the other hand, rigid-bodies are not enough to simulate, e.g., cars, ragdolls, or robotic systems, as those use-cases
require adding restrictions on the relative motion between their parts with joints.

In this chapter, we first show how to initialize a [physics world](#initializing-the-physics-world) which will construct
all that is to be physically simulated and will drive the physics simulation.

Then we introduce [colliders](#colliders) which are geometric shapes responsible for generating contacts or simulating
sensors. Colliders are attached to [rigid-bodies](#rigid-bodies) which are responsible for the simulation of
the object trajectory under various forces including gravity.  

## Basic setup
First, let's see what is the minimum set of elements that must be setup to have an empty physical simulation up and running:

The `PhysicsPipeline` is responsible for executing the whole simulation: collision detection as well as the simulation of
physical phenomena: gravity, contact forces, joints, etc. All the state contained by the `PhysicsPipeline` are workspace
buffers so you are free to discard it at any time without breaking the simulation. For example, it is perfectly fine
to re-instantiate a new `PhysicsPipeline` at each game loop iteration. However this will be less efficient due to
repeated allocations of the workspace buffers. All the actually useful simulation-related data are stored in the arguments
of `PhysicsPipeline::step`:

- The gravity is a global force affecting all dynamic rigid-bodies with non-zero mass.
- The `IntegrationParameters` contains elements to configure the constraint solver.
- The `BroadPhase` performs coarse AABB-based collision detections.
- The `NarrowPhase` performs precise contact point determination based on the collision pairs generated by the broad-phase.
- The `RigidBodySet` contains all the rigid-bodies part of the simulation.
- The `ColliderSet` contains all the colliders part of the simulation.
- The `JointSet` contains all the joint constraints part of the simulation.
- The `event_handler` will collect all the events generated by the physics pipeline. Setting this to `()` simply ignores
  these events.

All the mentioned sets associate a unique handle to each element they contain. These handles are generational indices so
they don't suffer from the ABA problem.

Each call to `pipeline.step(...)` will advance the simulation by a time equal to $1/60$ seconds, which is a good default if your
application has a refresh rate of 60Hz. The length of this timestep can be retrieved by `integration_parameters.dt()` and modified
using `integration_parameters.set_dt(value)`. Note that if you use the
recommanded [International System of Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) (SI units), this
timestep is to be given in seconds. Keep in mind that the timestep length strongly affects the accuracy of the simulation:
the smaller the timestep, the more accurate the simulation will be.

Changes of timesteps during the simulation should be avoided as much as possible since they may introduce numerical
instabilities or reduce the constraints solvers convergence.

:::warning
Note that we are free to replace the `pipeline` by a fresh instance of `PhysicsPipeline` whenever we want. This is not the
case for the other mutable components. Once at least one `pipeline.step` has been called with these components, they will be
inter-dependent. Replacing any of them (in subsequent calls to `.step`) with new/other instances may cause unexpected
behaviors. We are working to ensure this is no longer an issue in the future.

## Initializing the physics worlds
A working physics simulation requires two world structures to be created: the geometrical world and the mechanical world. The
**geometrical world** contains all the data structures and algorithms necessary to perform efficiently geometric operations like
computing sets of contacts between touching objects, detecting when two objects start interacting with each other, etc.
It is basically a wrapper around the data structures provided by the **ncollide2d** or **ncollide3d** [crate](https://ncollide.org).
A geometrical world can either be created with its default configuration:

```rust
let mut geometrical_world = DefaultGeometricalWorld::new();
```

or by manually giving it an instance of a broad-phase and a narrow-phase. This allows you to configure them with
custom parameters and contact/proximity algorithm dispatchers:

```rust
// Build a broad-phase instance.
let broad_phase = DBVTBroadPhase::new(na::convert(0.01));
// Needed to build a narrow phase instance.
let coll_dispatcher = Box::new(ContactDispatcher::new());
let prox_dispatcher = Box::new(DefaultProximityDispatcher::new());
// Build a narrow-phase instance.
let narrow_phase = NarrowPhase::new(coll_dispatcher, prox_dispatcher);

// Build the geometrical world.
let mut geometrical_world = DefaultGeometricalWorld::from_parts(broad_phase, narrow_phase);
```

The **mechanical world** contains all the data structures and algorithms necessary to perform efficiently the simulation of
physical phenomena like gravity, contact forces, deformations, etc. It can be constructed with a given gravity vector:

```rust
let gravity = Vector3::y() * -9.81;
let mut mechanical_world = DefaultMechanicalWorld::new(gravity);
```

The mechanical world has several fields, you are free to change them if you need some specific configuration.
For example if the gravity has to be changed, simply do `mechanical_world.gravity = new_gravity;` and it will be taken into
account during subsequent timesteps. Keep in mind however, that it is discouraged to change the constraints solver once
you started performing timesteps (with the `.step` method) as you may cause some cached data, that improves stability and
performance, to be reset. By default, the constraint solver handles contacts using the Signorini-Coulomb contact model (to
enforce non-penetration with friction). This can be changed for other contact models depending on your needs. Refer
to the dedicated [section](contact_models.md).


| Public field              | Description                                                  |
|--                         | --                                                           |
| `.counters`               | Various counters that measure internal performance of the physics engine. They are disabled by default. |
| `.solver`                 | The impulse-based constraints solver responsible for computing contact forces and fixing penetrations. |
| `.integration_parameters` | Parameters affecting the whole simulation. Find more details [here](/performance_tuning/#integration-parameters). |
| `.material_coefficients`  | A table that maps pairs of materials to material coefficients (for friction, restitution, and surface velocity). |
| `.gravity`                | The gravity affecting all dynamic bodies in the scene except those that are configured to ignore gravity. |

Once the physics world is created, the next step is to create some bodies that will take part in the simulation.

## Rigid-bodies
A rigid-body is the simplest type of body supported by **rapier**. It can be seen as the aggregation of a position,
orientation, and mass properties (rotational inertia tensor, mass, and center of mass). It does not hold any information
regarding its shape which can optionally be specified by attaching one or multiple [colliders](/docs/user_guides/rust/rigid_body_simulation#colliders)
to it. A rigid-body with no collider, but with a non-zero mass, will be affected by all the forces the world is aware of,
including joints attached to it, but not by contacts (because it does not have any shape that can be collided to).

### Creating a rigid-body

A rigid-body can only be created by a `RigidBodyBuilder` structure that is based on the builder pattern:

:::info
The following example shows all the possible setters that can be called to customize the 
rigid-body being built. The input values are just random so using this example
as-is will not lead to a useful result.

let _ = RigidBodyBuilder::new_dynamic();

// Builder for a body with a status specified by an enum.
let rigid_body = RigidBodyBuilder::new(BodyStatus::Dynamic)

    // The rigid body position. Will override `.translation(...)` and `.rotation(...)`.
    // Default: the identity isometry.
    .position(Isometry2::new(Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0), f32::PI))
    // The linear velocity of this body.
    // Default: zero velocity.
    .linvel(1.0, 2.0)
    // The angular velocity of this body.

    // Whether or not this body can sleep.
    // Default: true

    .build();
```

use rapier3d::na::{Vector3, Isometry3};
use rapier3d::dynamics::{BodyStatus, RigidBodyBuilder};

// Builder for a static rigid-body.

// Builder for a dynamic rigid-body.

    .can_sleep(true)
    // All done, actually build the rigid-body.
    .build();
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


All the properties are optional. The only calls that are required are `RigidBodyBuilder::new(status)`,
`RigidBodyBuilder::new_static()`, `RigidBodyBuilder::new_dynamic()`, or `RigidBodyBuilder::new_kinematic()`, to
initialize the builder, and `.build()` to actually build the rigid body.

Typically, the inertia and center of mass are automatically set to the inertia and center of mass resulting from the
shapes of the [colliders](#colliders) attached to the rigid-body.

<!--
 however this is not a requirement: you can for example
set the inertia and center of mass when building the rigid-body, and only attach to it colliders without density so
they don't contribute to this inertia and center of mass.

:::note
The `.build()` method of the `RigidBodyBuilder` returns the newly created rigid-body. It is
still possible to further modify it after creation:
:::

```rust
let mut rigid_body = RigidBodyBuilder::new()
                        .translation(Vector3::x() * 2.0)
                        .build();
rigid_body.set_mass(10.0);
```
-->

### The rigid-body handle
Once the rigid body is created it must be added to a `RigidBodySet`. A body set is a container that maps a unique handle to
a body:

```rust
let mut body_set = RigidBodySet::new();
let handle = body_set.insert(rigid_body);
```

Upon insertion, the body set will return a handle to the rigid body. This will allow use to get a reference to this body
later if needed:

```rust
let rigid_body = body_set.get(handle);     // Retrieve an immutable reference.
let rigid_body = body_set.get_mut(handle); // Retrieve a mutable reference.
```

:::note
No two bodies in the same body set will share the same handle. This handle is what you should store for future
addressing of this rigid body as it is required by various operations including: attaching colliders or joints
to the rigid-body.
:::


### Body statuses
Any body can have one of three different statuses identified by the `dynamics::BodyStatus` enumeration:

* **`BodyStatus::Dynamic`:** It indicates the body is affected by external forces, inertial forces (gyroscopic, coriolis, etc.)
    and contacts.
* **`BodyStatus::Static`:** Indicates the body cannot move. It acts as if it has an infinite mass and will not be
    affected by any force. It will continue to collide with dynamic bodies but not with static nor with kinematic
    bodies. This is typically used for the ground or for temporarily freezing a body.
* **`BodyStatus::Kinematic`:** Indicates the body position must not be altered by the physics engine. The user is
    free to set any position and the body velocity will be deduced at each update accordingly to ensure a realistic
    behavior of dynamic bodies in contact with it. This is typically used for moving **platforms**, **elevators**, etc.

<!--
* **`BodyStatus::Disabled`:** Indicates the body should be completely ignored by the physics engine. In practice,
    this will remove all contacts this body is involved with and disable (but not remove) all joint constraints
    attached to it.

For example, to change the status of a rigid-body, you need to retrieve a mutable reference to it and then call the
`.set_status(...)` method:

```rust
let mut rb = body_set.get_mut(handle).expect("Rigid-body not found.");
rb.set_status(BodyStatus::Kinematic);
// Sets the velocity of the kinematic rigid-body.
rb.set_velocity(Velocity::linear(0.0, 0.0, 1.0));
```
-->

<!--
### Kinematic degrees of freedom
Some bodies allow to mark only some of their degrees of freedom as kinematic. For example:

* It is possible to mark as kinematic some translations or rotations of a rigid body. This is useful to prevent
  all translations and/or rotations wrt. some specific coordinate axes, or to control them at the velocity level.
  This is achieved by the `.kinematic_translations` and `kinematic_rotations` modifiers at construction-time, or by
  the `.set_translations_kinematic` and `.set_rotations_kinematic` methods after construction:

```rust
let rigid_body = RigidBodyBuilder::new()
    // Translations along the y and z axises will be locked and controllable at the
    // velocity level by the user.
    .kinematic_translations(Vector3::new(false, true, true));
    .velocity(Velocity::linear(1.0, 0.0, 3.0))
    .build();

// NOTE: the velocity of the rigid body along the `y` and `z` axis will remain
// constant independently from any forces. Therefore this body will be fixed
// in translation wrt the `y` axis, and will translate with a velocity of `3.0`
// along the `z` axis.
```

This second example changes the kinematic degrees of freedom of a rigid body after its creation and addition to the body
set, using its handle. Now the translations along `x` as well as rotations wrt. the axes `x` and `z` will be locked and
controllable at the velocity level:

```rust
let rb = body_set.rigid_body_mut(handle).expect("Rigid body not found");
rb.set_translations_kinematic(Vector3::new(true, false, false))
rb.set_rotations_kinematic(Vector3::new(true, false, true));
```

:::note "Rigid bodies that cannot rotate"
It can be useful to prevent a rigid-body from rotating at all, e.g., for the player entity of a video game.
This can be achieved by setting all its rotations as kinematic, or, equivalently, by calling
`.disable_all_rotations()` on the rigid body. Note that `.disable_all_rotations()` will also set the rigid-body
angular velocity to zero in addition to marking all its rotational degrees of freedom as kinematic.
:::

* It is possible to mark some nodes of a deformable body as kinematic so that those nodes remain fixed in space or can
  be controlled by the user at the velocity level. See the [deformable bodies](/deformable_bodies/) section.

:::note ""Controllable at the velocity level""
We used the term **controllable at the velocity level** multiple times here. This means it is still possible for the
user to set a non-zero velocity to a kinematic body or a dynamic body with kinematic degrees of freedom. A kinematic
body or the kinematic degrees of freedom will keep this velocity constant no matter what. This is useful for platforms
that should have a specific trajectory without being disturbed by any force of the world. Of course, the user can
still modify this trajectory by changing the velocity of those kinematic elements at any time.

## Colliders
Colliders represent the geometric shapes that generate contacts and proximity events when they touch.

### Creating a collider
A collider is built by a `ColliderBuilder` structure following the builder pattern:

:::info
The following example shows all the possible setters that can be called to customize the
collider being built. The input values are just random so using this example as-is will not
lead to a useful result.

    // Default: false

### The collider handle
Once the collider is created it must be added to a collider set. A collider set is a container that maps a unique handle to
a collider:

```rust
let mut collider_set = ColliderSet::new();
let handle = collider_set.insert(collider, parent_handle, &mut rigid_body_set);
```

When inserting the collider, it will be attached to the rigid-body specified by is handle `parent_handle`.
Upon insertion, the collider set will return a handle to the collider. This will allow you to get a reference to this
collider if needed later:

```rust
let collider = body_set.get(handle);     // Retrieve an immutable reference.
let collider = body_set.get_mut(handle); // Retrieve a mutable reference.
```

:::note
No two colliders in the same collider set will share the same handle. This handle is what you should store for future
addressing of this collider.
:::

<!--

### Collider with parent
Every collider must be attached to a body part by specifying the body part handle when building the collider:

```rust
let parent_rigid_body = RigidBodyBuilder::new()
    .build();
let parent_handle = body_set.insert(parent_rigid_body);

let shape = ShapeHandle::new(Ball::new(1.5));
let collider = ColliderBuilder::new(shape)
    .density(1.0)
    .translation(Vector3::y() * 5.0)
    .build();
let collider_handle = collider_set.insert(collider, parent_handle, &mut body_set);
```

In this example the body part handle we specified was `BodyPartHandle(parent_handle, 0)`. This means that the collider
will be attached to the first part (indexing of body parts starts at 0) of the body identified by `parent_handle`. A rigid
body always has one part. Other bodies like [multibodies](/joint_constraints_and_multibodies/#multibodies) are composed
of several body parts. Thus, attaching a collider to a multibody link requires specifying the index of the specific
link: `BodyPartHandle(parent_handle, link_index)` where `link_index` is an integer lying between 0 and the total number
of links the multibody has.

:::Note
    If a collider is given a density, it will contribute to the mass and angular inertia of the body part it is
    attached to.
:::

The following shows a way to retrieve the handle of the body attached to a collider:

```rust
// Assuming `collider_handle` is a valid handle of a collider previously added to the world.
let collider = collider_set.get(collider_handle).expect("Collider not found.");
let body_handle = collider.body();
```

### Collision groups
It is possible to configure a subset of colliders to collide only with another subset of colliders. This is the goal of
**collision groups**. Collision groups are demonstrated on the [Collision groups](/all_examples3/?collision_groups) example where
only colliders with the same colors can collide with one another. The source-code of the demo is available on
[github](https://github.com/rustsim/rapier/blob/master/examples3d/collision_groups3.rs). A collider's collision group
can be configured in a `ColliderBuilder` before it is built into the physics world.

Because this is a feature from the **ncollide2d** and **ncollide3d** crates, an in-depth description of collision
groups is given in [that section](https://ncollide.org/collision_detection_pipeline/#collision-groups) of their
dedicated user guide.

## Gravity, forces, and impulses
There are three ways of applying forces to a body in **rapier**. The most common force is gravity and
is treated as a special case by **rapier**. Finally, forces, impulses, and instantaneous velocity or acceleration
changes can be [applied](#one-time-force-application-and-impulses) for a single timestep to each body part individually.

### Gravity
Because gravity is such a common force, it is a special case within **rapier**.
It is set at the creation of the mechanical world and can be changed later with the mechanical world's
`.gravity` public field:

```rust
let mut mechanical_world = MechanicalWorld::new();
mechanical_world.gravity = Vector3::y() * -9.81; // or Vector2 in 2D.
```

Even though gravity automatically affects all the dynamic bodies, it is possible to cancel the effect of gravity
on a specific body:

* By disabling gravity for this body before it is constructed by calling the `.gravity_enabled(false)` setter. Example:

```rust
let mut rigid_body = RigidBodyBuilder::new()
   // ... other initialization accessors.
   // Disable gravity for rigid bodies built by this RigidBodyBuilder.
   .gravity_enabled(false)
   .build();
```

* Or by calling `body.enable_gravity(false)` on a body that has already been created into the physics world. This
    `.enable_gravity` method is part of the [`Body`](https://www.rapier.org/rustdoc/rapier3d/object/trait.Body.html)
    trait:

```rust
let mut rb = body_set.body_mut(rb_handle).expect("Rigid body not found.");
rb.enable_gravity(false);
```

### One-time force application and impulses
It is possible to apply a force to any body part, at any of its points. In the following, let us call $~f$ a force we
apply at the center of mass of a body part. We distinguish four kinds of forces listed in the `ForceType` enum:

* `ForceType::Force`: a force as in the formula $~f = mass × acceleration$. Applying this force to a body will
   add a velocity of $~\frac{f}{mass} × dt$ (where $~dt$ is the time step length) to the body part's velocity at the next
   timestep.
* `ForceType::AccelerationChange`: a direct acceleration change that will add $~f × dt$ to the body part's velocity at the next timestep.
* `ForceType::Impulse`: an impulsive force that immediately adds $~\frac{f}{mass}$ to the body part's velocity.
* `ForceType::VelocityChange`: a direct velocity change that immediately adds $~f$ to the body part's velocity.

!!! Note
    All forces applied to a body part are cleared during the next timestep. Therefore a persistent force
    should be re-applied at each frame.

Several methods of the `Body` trait can be called in order to apply a force to a body part:

```rust
use rapier2d::math::{Force, ForceType}; // For 2D
use rapier3d::math::{Force, ForceType}; // For 3D

// Force application at the body part's center of mass.
fn apply_force(&mut self, part_id: usize, f: &Force<N>, force_type: ForceType, auto_wake_up: bool);
fn apply_local_force(&mut self, part_id: usize, f: &Force<N>, force_type: ForceType, auto_wake_up: bool);

// Force application at a custom point on the body part.
fn apply_force_at_point(&mut self, part_id: usize, f: &Vector<N>, point: &Point<N>, force_type: ForceType, auto_wake_up: bool);
fn apply_local_force_at_point(&mut self, part_id: usize, f: &Vector<N>, point: &Point<N>, force_type: ForceType, auto_wake_up: bool);
fn apply_force_at_local_point(&mut self, part_id: usize, f: &Vector<N>, point: &Point<N>, force_type: ForceType, auto_wake_up: bool);
fn apply_local_force_at_local_point(&mut self, part_id: usize, f: &Vector<N>, point: &Point<N>, force_type: ForceType, auto_wake_up: bool);
```

Every method takes very similar arguments among which:

* **part_id** is the index of the body's part you want to apply the force to. For rigid bodies, this argument should be
zero since a rigid body has only one part.
* **auto_wake_up** controls whether the body affected by the force should be woken up automatically because of this force
  application. This should typically be set to `true` whenever you are applying a one-time force manually. This should
  likely be set to `false` if you are applying a continuous force from a force generator (so that bodies reaching a dynamic
  equilibrium can be put to sleep again).
