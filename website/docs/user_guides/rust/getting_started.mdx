## Setting up Rapier with Cargo
**rapier** relies on the official Rust package manager
[Cargo](https://crates.io) for dependency resolution and compilation. Therefore,
making **rapier** ready to be used by your project is simply a matter of
adding a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file. You can either use the [**rapier2d**
crate](https://crates.io/crates/rapier2d) for 2D physics simulation or the [**rapier3d** crate](https://crates.io/crates/rapier3d)
for 3D physics simulation. You will also need the **nalgebra** crate as well because it defines algebraic entities
(vectors, points, transformation matrices): it is automatically re-exported as `rapier2d::na` and `rapier3d::na`.

Until **rapier** reaches 1.0, it is strongly recommended to always use its
latest version, though you may encounter breaking changes from time to time.

To get the best of **rapier** multiple features can be enabled optionally:
- `simd-stable`: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the [`wide` crate](https://crates.io/crates/wide).
Has limited cross-platform support but can be used with a stable version of the Rust compiler.
- `simd-nightly`: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the [`packed_simd` crate](https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd).
Has a great cross-platform support but requires a nightly version of the Rust compiler.
- `parallel`: enables parallelism of the physics pipeline with the [`rayon` crate](https://crates.io/crates/rayon).
- `serde-serialize`: enables serialization of the physics components with [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).
- `enhanced-determinism`: enables cross-platform determinism across all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms that implements the
IEEE 754-2008 standard strictly. This includes most modern processors as well as WASM targets.
- `wasm-bindgen`: enables usage of `rapier` as a dependency of a WASM crate that is compiled with `wasm-bindgen`.

Currently, the `enhanced-determinism` feature cannot be enabled at the same time as the `parallel` or
`simd-{stable,nightly}` features.
