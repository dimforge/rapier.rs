During the course of a physics simulation, colliders will collides, and sensors will be activated. These events can
be retrieved in order to apply custom game logics. There are currently two types of events:
- Contact events triggered when two colliders start or stop having contact points.
- Intersection events triggered when one sensor collider and another collider start or stop touching.

In order to listen to these physics events, we need to:
1. Create and `EventQueue` which is responsible for collecting events occurring during one timestep.
2. Call `world.step(eventQueue)` instead of `world.step()` to advance the simulation.
3. Iterate through the events using `eventQueue.drainContactEvents` and `eventsQueue.drainIntersectionEvents`.

The parameter of the `EventQueue` constructor indicates whether or not the queue should be automatically cleared at
the beginning of each `step` call. Setting this to `false` will allow us to handle events that were generated
by previous timesteps. However, this may cause a memory overflow if the queue is never cleared or drained. If it is
set to `true`, then we need to handle the all physics events in-between each calls to `step`; all unhandled
events that occurred before the last call to `step` will be lost.

Handling the events is achieved by calling the corresponding drain function. This function will clear the event queue
and pass all its items to a JS closure:
- The `eventQueue.drainContactEvents` drains all the contact events. The input closure is expected to take three arguments:
two integers and one boolean. The twe integers are the handles of the colliders involved in the contact. We can retrieve
the actual collider reference form its integer handle using `world.getCollider(handle)`. The boolean indicates whether the
two colliders are starting to be in contact (true) or no longer have any contact point (false).
- The `eventQueue.drainIntersection` drain all the proximity events. The input closure is expected to take three arguments,
two integers and one boolean. The two integers are the handles of the colliders
involved in the proximity. The boolean indicates if they are intersecting.
