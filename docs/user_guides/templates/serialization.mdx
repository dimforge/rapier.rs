When the `serde-serialize` feature of Rapier is enabled, most data structures of Rapier become serializable using [serde](http://serde.rs).
Serialization can be useful to save the complete state of the simulation, e.g., to send it over the network, or to restore
this state later. In order to fully serialize the simulation state, it is necessary to serialize every structure
described in the [simulation structures](simulation_structures) page, except for the `PhysicsPipeline` and the
`CollisionPipeline` which don't hold any useful state. The following shows an example of serialization of the
complete physics state. For convenience, the example defines a `PhysicsState` serializable struct that wraps every
relevant serializable state. It uses [bincode](https://crates.io/crates/bincode) as the serialization format:

```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_serialization.rs' marker='Serialization' />
```

:::info
If the `enhanced-determinism` feature of Rapier is enabled, and if your platform fulfills the required [determinism
requirements](determinism), then you have the guarantee that running the exact same simulation on two different machine
will result in the exact same byte vectors if the physics state is serialized on both machines after the same
number of timesteps.

It is possible to take a snapshot of the whole physics world with `world.takeSnapshot`. This results in a byte array
of type `Uint8Array` that may be saved on the disk, sent through the network, etc. The snapshot can then be restored
with `let world = World.restoreSnapshot(snapshot);`.
