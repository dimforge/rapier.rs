If enabled, the **autostep** setting allows the character to climb stairs automatically and walk over small obstacles.
Autostepping requires the following parameters:
- The **maximum height** the character can step over. If the vertical movement needed to step over this obstacle is larger
than this value, then the character will be stopped by the obstacle.
- The **minimum (horizontal) width** available on top of the obstacle. If, after the character is teleported on top of the obstacle, it
cannot move forward by a distance larger than this minimum width, then the character will just be stopped by the obstacle
(without being moved to the top of the obstacle).
- Whether or not autostepping is **enabled for dynamic bodies**. If it is not enabled for dynamic bodies, the character
wonâ€™t attempt to automatically step over small dynamic bodies. Disabling this can be useful if we want the character to
push these small objects (see [collisions](./character_controller_stairs.mdx#collisions)) instead of just stepping over them.

The following depicts (top) one configuration where all the autostepping conditions are satisfied, and, (bottom) two
configurations where these conditions are not all satisfied (left: because the width of the step is too small, right:
because the height of the step is too large):

:::info
Autostepping will only activate if the character is touching the floor right before the obstacle.
This prevents the player from being teleported on to of a platform while it is in the air.
