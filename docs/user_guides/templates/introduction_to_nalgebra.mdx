[**nalgebra**](https://nalgebra.org) is a general-purpose linear algebra library written in Rust. It has an extensive
set of features including vectors, matrices, transformations, factorizations, etc. Because **nalgebra** is used
extensively by Rapier and its API, the goal of this page is to give a very quick introduction to some basic features
of **nalgebra** that you will need to use **Rapier**.

## Vectors
Vectors are matrices with a single column. They are used in **Rapier** to express various quantities like velocities
forces, etc. Whereas **nalgebra** supports vectors of any size, **Rapier** mostly uses 2D and 3D vectors: the `Vector2`
and `Vector3` type aliases form **nalgebra**.

:::info
Whenever you see the `Vector` type appearing in the API of Rapier, it means `Vector2` if you are
using the 2D version of Rapier, or `Vector3` if you are using the 3D version of Rapier.
:::
:::info
Whenever you see `AngVector` appearing in the API of Rapier, it means `f32` (or `f64`) if you are using the 2D
version of Rapier, or `Vector3` if you are using the 3D version of Rapier.

There are various ways of creating a vector. They are shown in the example bellow:

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```rust
use nalgebra::{Vector2, vector};
let v = Vector2::new(1.0, 2.0); // Basic constructor.
let v = vector![1.0, 2.0];      // Macro.
let v = [1.0, 2.0].into();      // From<[T; 2]> conversion.
```

Accessing the components of a vector can be done by indexing or using its `x,y` fields:

```rust
let v = vector![1.0, 2.0]; // 2D vector.
assert_eq!(v.x, 1.0);  assert_eq!(v.y, 2.0);
assert_eq!(v[0], 1.0); assert_eq!(v[1], 2.0);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```rust
use nalgebra::{Vector3, vector};
let v = Vector3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0); // Basic constructor.
let v = vector![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];      // Macro.
let v = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].into();      // From<[T; 3]> conversion.
```

Accessing the components of a vector can be done by indexing or using its `x,y,z` fields:

```rust
let v = vector![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]; // 3D vector.
assert_eq!(v.x, 1.0);  assert_eq!(v.y, 2.0);  assert_eq!(v.z, 3.0);
assert_eq!(v[0], 1.0); assert_eq!(v[1], 2.0); assert_eq!(v[2], 3.0);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Points
Points are wrappers around vectors, but with a different semantic than vectors. A point can be interpreted as a location in
space whereas a vector can be seen as a direction or a displacement between two points. For example
a contact between two shapes has contact points (the location of the contact in space) represented as points,
and has a contact normal (the direction used to apply forces) represented as a vector.

Points are created/accessed in a way very similar to [vectors](./introduction_to_nalgebra.mdx#vectors):

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```rust
use nalgebra::{Point2, point};
let pt = Point2::new(1.0, 2.0); // Basic constructor.
let pt = point![1.0, 2.0];      // Macro.
let pt = [1.0, 2.0].into();     // From<[T; 2]> conversion.

assert_eq!(pt.x, 1.0);  assert_eq!(pt.y, 2.0);
assert_eq!(pt[0], 1.0); assert_eq!(pt[1], 2.0);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```rust
use nalgebra::{Point3, point};
let pt = Point3::new(1.0, 2.0, 3.0); // Basic constructor.
let pt = point![1.0, 2.0, 3.0];      // Macro.
let pt = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0].into();     // From<[T; 3]> conversion.

assert_eq!(pt.x, 1.0);  assert_eq!(pt.y, 2.0);  assert_eq!(pt.z, 3.0);
assert_eq!(pt[0], 1.0); assert_eq!(pt[1], 2.0); assert_eq!(pt[2], 3.0);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
It is possible to access the vector wrapped by a point by accessing its `coords` field: `pt.coords`.
:::

## Isometries
An isometry represents a rotation followed by a translation. Isometries are often used within Rapier to represent
the position of a [rigid-body](./rigid_bodies.mdx#position) or a [collider](./colliders.mdx#position). By **position**, we generally
mean both the translation and the orientation of the rigid-body or collider.
- In 2D, the translational part of an isometry is represented as a `Vector2`, and the rotational part
  is represented as a `UnitComplex` number (a complex number with a norm equal to 1).
- In 3D the translational part of an isometry is represented as a `Vector3`, and the rotational part
  is represented as a `UnitQuaternion` (a quaternion with a norm equal to 1).

Various ways of constructing an isometry are shown bellow:

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```rust
use nalgebra::{Isometry2, vector};
let iso = Isometry2::translation(1.0, 2.0);
let iso = Isometry2::rotation(0.5); // 0.5 is a rotation angle in radians.
let iso = Isometry2::new(vector![1.0, 2.0], 0.5);
assert_eq!(iso.rotation.angle(), 0.5);
assert_eq!(iso.translation.vector.x, 1.0);
assert_eq!(iso.translation.vector.y, 2.0);
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```rust
use nalgebra::{Isometry3, vector};
let iso = Isometry3::translation(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
let iso = Isometry3::rotation(vector![0.1, 0.5, 0.7]); // The vector is the rotation in axis-angle format.
let iso = Isometry3::new(vector![1.0, 2.0, 3.0], vector![0.1, 0.5, 0.7]);
assert_eq!(iso.rotation.scaled_axis(), vector![0.1, 0.5, 0.7]);
assert_eq!(iso.translation.vector, vector![1.0, 2.0, 3.0]);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Isometries can be used to transform points and vectors using multiplication: `isometry * point` or `isometry * vector`.

:::warning
Because **points** represent a **location** in space, `isometry * point` will rotate and translate the point. However,
because **vectors** represent a **direction**, `isometry * vector` will only rotate the vector (the translation part
of the isometry will be ignored).

## Interoperability with glam
[**glam**](https://crates.io/crates/glam) is another linear-algebra library written in Rust. It is popular within
the Rust game development community and is used by several popular crates like [**Bevy**](https://bevyengine.org),
[**macroquad**](https://crates.io/crates/macroquad), etc.

It is possible to convert **nalgebra** types from/to **glam** types (using the standard library's `From` and `Into` traits)
by enabling one of the conversion cargo features of **nalgebra**:
- The `convert-glam013` features will enable conversion from/to **glam 0.13**.
- The `convert-glam014` features will enable conversion from/to **glam 0.14**.
- The `convert-glam015` features will enable conversion from/to **glam 0.15**.
- The same feature naming conversion will be used for the other supported version of glam.

<bevy>

:::info
The feature is already enabled by the bevy-rapier plugin. The selected version depends on the version
of glam used by Bevy.
:::

</bevy>

Here are examples of conversions these features enable:
- Conversion between `na::Vector2` and `glam::Vec2`.
- Conversion between `na::Vector3` and `glam::Vec3`.
- Conversion between `na::Point2` and `glam::Vec2`.
- Conversion between `na::Point3` and `glam::Vec3`.
- Conversion between `na::Isometry2` and the tuple `(glam::Vec2, f32)`.
- Conversion between `na::Isometry3` and the tuple `(glam::Vec3, glam::Quat)`.
- Conversion from `glam::Vec2` to `na::Isometry2` (builds a translation-only isometry).
- Conversion from `glam::Vec3` to `na::Isometry3` (builds a translation-only isometry).
- Conversion from `glam::Quat` to `na::Isometry3` (builds a rotation-only isometry).
