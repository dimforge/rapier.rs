[Event handlers](advanced_collision_detection#contact-and-intersection-events) are user-defined callbacks used to be
notified when two colliders start/stop touching. By default no collision event is generated by
the narrow-phase. In order to enable a collision event for a pair of colliders, at
least one of the involved colliders must have the corresponding event set as active. An event is activated for a collider
by setting its corresponding active events bit to `1`:
- Setting the <notjs>`ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS`</notjs><js>`ActiveEvents.COLLISION_EVENTS`</js> bit to 1
  enables the [collision events](advanced_collision_detection#collision-events) involving the collider.

The active events of a collider can be set when the collider is created or after its creation:

<rapier>

```rust
/* Set the active events when the collider is created. */
let collider = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
    .active_events(ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS)
    .build();
```
```rust
/* Set the active events after the collider creation. */
let collider = collider_set.get_mut(collider_handle).unwrap();
collider.set_active_events(ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS);
assert!(collider.active_events().contains(ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS));
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
/* Set the active events when the collider is created. */
let collider = ColliderBundle {
    flags: (ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS).into(),
    ..Default::default()
};
commands.spawn_bundle(collider);
commands.spawn()
    .insert(Collider::ball(0.5))
    .insert(ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS);
```
```rust
/* Set the active events inside of a system. */
fn modify_collider_active_events(mut active_events: Query<&mut ActiveEvents>) {
    for mut active_events in active_events.iter_mut() {
        *active_events = ActiveEvents::COLLISION_EVENTS;
    }
}
```

</bevy>
<js>

```js
/* Set the active events when the collider is created. */
let colliderDesc = RAPIER.ColliderDesc.ball(0.5)
    .setActiveEvents(RAPIER.ActiveEvents.COLLISION_EVENTS);
let collider = world.createCollider(colliderDesc);
```
```js
/* Set the active events after the collider creation. */
collider.setActiveEvents(RAPIER.ActiveEvents.COLLISION_EVENTS);
```
