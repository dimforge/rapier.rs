Ray-casting is a geometric query that finds one or several colliders intersecting a half-line. Ray-casting is an
extremely common operation that covers a wide variety of use-cases: firing bullets, character controllers,
rendering (for ray-tracing), etc.

A ray is defined by its origin and its direction: it can be interpreted as a single point moving in a straight
line towards the ray direction.

:::info
In addition to the ray geometric information, ray-casting method allow additional control over the behavior of the
ray cast like limiting the length of the ray and ignoring some colliders. See the detailed ray-cast arguments description
after the next example.
:::

There are multiple ray-casting methods yielding more or less detailed results (see example bellow). The more results you
get, the more computationally expensive the ray-cast will be.

Aside from the ray being cast, all these ray-casting methods take a few extra parameters for controlling the behavior
of the ray-cast:
- <notjs> **`max_toi`** </notjs><js> **`maxToi`** </js>: is the maximum "time-of-impact" that can be reported by the ray-cast. The notion of "time-of-impact" refer
to the fact that a ray can be seen as a point starting at `ray.origin` moving at a linear velocity equal
to `ray.dir`. Therefore, `max_toi` limits the ray-cast to the segment: `[ray.origin, ray.origin + ray.dir * max_toi]`.
- **`solid`**: this argument controls the behavior of the ray-cast if `ray.origin` is inside of a shape: if `solid` is `true`
then the hit point will be the ray origin itself (`toi = 0.0`) because the interior of the shape will be assumed
to be filled with material. If `solid` is `false` then the shape will be assumed to have an empty interior and
the hit point will be the first time the ray hits the shape's boundary. The following 2D example illustrates
the difference between the two scenarios. The ray is in green and the resulting hit point circled in red:

</div>

In addition, it is possible to only apply the scene query to a subsets of the colliders using [a query filter](./scene_queries_ray_casting.mdx#query-filters).
