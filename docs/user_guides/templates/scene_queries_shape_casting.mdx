Shape-casting (aka. sweep tests) is the big brother of ray-casting. The only difference with ray-cast is that instead of being a point
travelling along a straight line, we have a complete shape travelling along a straight line. This is typically used for
character controllers in games to determine by how much the player can move before it hits the environment.

:::info
Just like ray-casting, it is possible to control the behavior of the shape-casting like limiting the distance
travelled by the shape cast, and ignoring some colliders. See the details about the `max_toi` and
`filter` arguments in the [ray-casting](#ray-casting) section.
:::

There is only one shape-casting method: <rapier>`QueryPipeline::cast_shape`</rapier><bevy>`RapierContext::cast_shape`</bevy><js>`World.castShape`</js>.
This method has similar arguments as <rapier>`QueryPipeline::cast_ray`</rapier><bevy>`RapierContext::cast_ray`</bevy><js>`World.castRay`</js> except
that the ray is replaced by three arguments: the **shape** being cast, the **initial position** of the shape (this is analog to `ray.origin`) and
the **linear velocity** the shape is travelling at (this is analog to `ray.dir`):

The result of the shape-casting includes the handle of the first collider being hit, as well as
detailed information about the geometry of the hit:
- **`hit.toi`**: indicates the time of impact between the shape and the collider hit. This means that
after travelling a distance of <notjs>`shape_vel * hit.toi`</notjs><js>`shapeVel * hit.toi`</js> the collider and the
cast shape are exactly touching. If `hit.toi == 0.0` then the shape is already intersecting a collider at its initial
position.
- **`hit.witness1`**: indicates the contact point when the cast shape and the collider are touching, expressed in the
local-space of the collider hit by the shape.
- **`hit.witness2`**: indicates the contact point when the cast shape and the collider are touching, expressed in the
local-space of the cast shape.
- **`hit.normal1`**: indicates the normal at the contact point `hit.witness1`, expressed in the local-space of
the collider hit by the shape.
- **`hit.normal2`**: indicates the normal at the contact point `hit.witness2`, expressed in the local-space of
the cast shape.
