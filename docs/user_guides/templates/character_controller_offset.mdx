For performance and numerical stability reasons, the character controller will attempt to preserve a small gap between
the character shape and the environment. This small gap is named `offset` and acts as a small margin around the character
shape. A good value for this offset is something sufficiently small to make the gap unnoticeable, but sufficiently large
to avoid numerical issues (if the character seems to get stuck inexplicably, try increasing the offset).

```rust
// The character offset is set to 0.01.
character_controller.offset = CharacterLength::Absolute(0.01);
// The character offset is set to 0.01 multiplied by the shape’s height.
character_controller.offset = CharacterLength::Relative(0.01);
```

```rust
<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/character_controller2.rs' marker="Offset" />
```

</bevy>
<js>

```js
// Here the character controller is initialized with an offset of 0.01.
let offset = 0.01;
let characterController = world.createCharacterController(0.01);
```

</js>

:::warning
It is **not recommended** to change the offset after the creation of the character controller.
