The character controller implementation is exposed as the `KinematicCharacterController` structure. This structure only
contains information about the character controller’s behavior. It does not contain any collider-specific or
rigid-body-specific information like handles, velocities, positions, etc. Therefore, the same instance of `KinematicCharacterController`
can be used to control multiple rigid-bodies/colliders if they rely on the same set of parameters.
The `KinematicCharacterController` exposes only two methods:
- `move_shape` is responsible for calculating the possible movement of a character based on
  the desired movement, obstacles, and character controller options.
- `solve_character_collision_impulses` is detailed in the [collisions section](#collisions).

The recommended way to update the character’s position depends on its representation:
- A **collider** not attached to any rigid-body: set the collider’s position directly to the corrected movement added to its current position.
- A **velocity-based kinematic rigid-body**: set its velocity to the computed movement divided by the timestep length.
- A **position-based kinematic rigid-body**: set its next kinematic position to the corrected movement added to its current position.

There are two ways to use the character-controller with `bevy_rapier`: using the `KinematicCharacterController` component
or using the `RapierContext::move_shape` method. The component approach is more convenient, but the `move_shape` approach
can be slightly more flexible in terms of filtering.

:::note
Refer to the API documentation of `RapierContext::move_shape` for details on how to use it.
:::

The `KinematicCharacterController` component must be added to the same entity as a `TransformBundle` bundle. If the field
`KinematicCharacterController::custom_shape` isn’t set, then the entity it is attached to must also contain a `Collider` component.
That collider optionally be attached to a rigid-body. At each frame, the `KinematicCharacterController::translation`
field can be set to the desired translation for that character.

During the next physics update step, that translation will
be resolved against obstacles, and the resulting movement will be automatically applied to the entity’s transform, or the
transform of the entity containing the rigid-body the collider to move is attached to.

The applied character motion, and the information of whether the character
is touching the ground at its final position, can be read with the `KinematicCharacterControllerOutput` component
(inserted automatically to the same entity as the `KinematicCharacterController` component).

A new character controller can be created and removed by the physics `World`:

```js
// The gap the controller will leave between the character and its environment.
let offset = 0.01;
// Create the controller.
let characterController = world.createCharacterController(offset);
// Remove the controller once we are done with it.
world.removeCharacterController(characterController);
```

Note that the character controller does not store a reference to the rigid-body and collider it controls. Therefore, the
same instance of the `CharacterController` class can be used to control different colliders. This can be useful if
you want to apply the same kind of character control settings to multiple characters.

The created character controller can then be used to control the movement of a collider taking into account obstacles
on its path. This is done in two steps:
1. Given a desired translation, compute the actual translation that we can apply to the collider based on the obstacles.
2. Read the result and apply it to the rigid-body or collider (if it isn’t attached to a rigid-body) by setting its
   position, kinematic velocity, or next kinematic position, depending on the situation.

```js
let characterController = world.createCharacterController(offset);
characterController.computeColliderMovement(
    collider,           // The collider we would like to move.
    desiredTranslation, // The movement we would like to apply if there wasn’t any obstacle.
);
// Read the result.
let correctedMovement = characterController.computedMovement();
// TODO: apply this corrected movement by following the rules described bellow.
```

The recommended way to update the character’s position depends on its representation:
- A **collider not attached** to any rigid-body: set the collider’s position directly (with `collider.setTranslation`)
  to the corrected movement added to its current position.
- A **velocity-based kinematic rigid-body**: set its velocity (with `rigidBody.setLinvel`) to the computed movement
  divided by the timestep length.
- A **position-based kinematic rigid-body**: set its next kinematic position (with `rigidBody.setNextKinematicTranslation`)
  to the corrected movement added to its current position.

:::info
The character’s shape may be any shape supported by Rapier. However, it is recommended to either use a cuboid,
a ball, or a capsule since they involve less computations and less numerical approximations.
:::

:::warning
The built-in character controller **does not** support rotational movement. It only supports translations.
