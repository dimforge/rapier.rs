If enabled, **snap-to-ground** will force the character to stick to the ground if the following conditions are met
simultaneously:
- At the start of the movement, the character touches the ground.
- The movement has no up component (i.e. the character isn’t jumping).
- At the end of the desired movement, the character would be separated from the ground by a distance smaller than the
distance provided by the **snap-to-ground** parameter.

If these conditions are met, the character is automatically teleported down to the ground at the end of its motion.
Typical usages of snap-to-ground include going downstairs or remaining in contact with the floor when moving downhill.

```rust
// Set snap-to-ground to None to disable it.
character_controller.snap_to_ground = None;
// Snap to the ground if the vertical distance to the ground is smaller than 0.5.
character_controller.snap_to_ground = Some(CharacterLength::Absolute(0.5));
// Snap to the ground if the vertical distance to the ground is smaller than 0.2 times the character’s height.
character_controller.snap_to_ground = Some(CharacterLength::Relative(0.2));
