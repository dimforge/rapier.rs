The velocity of a dynamic rigid-body controls how fast it is moving in time. The velocity is applied at the **center-of-mass**
of the rigid-body, and is composed of two independent parts:
1. The **linear velocity** is specified as a vector representing the direction and magnitude of the movement.
2. In 3D, the **angular velocity** is given as a vector representing the rotation
   axis multiplied by the rotation angular speed in `rad/s` (axis-angle representation). In 2D, the **angular velocity** is
   given as a real representing the angular speed in `rad/s`.

:::info
The velocity is only relevant to **dynamic** rigid-bodies. It has no effect on fixed rigid-bodies, and the
velocity of kinematic rigid-bodies are automatically computed at each timestep based on their next kinematic
positions.
:::

The velocity of a rigid-body is automatically updated by the physics pipeline after taking forces, contacts,
and joints into account. It can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:

Alternatively, the velocity of a dynamic rigid-body can be altered indirectly by
[applying a force or an impulse](#forces-and-impulses).
