## Installing Rapier from NPM
Rapier is available as the [@dimforge/rapier2d](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dimforge/rapier2d) and
[@dimforge/rapier3d](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dimforge/rapier3d) NPM packages. You may add the following to
your `package.json`:

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@dimforge/rapier2d": "*", // Replace the * by the latest version number.
  }
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@dimforge/rapier3d": "*", // Replace the * by the latest version number.
  }
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Because Rapier is actually a WebAssembly module, it has to be loaded asynchronously. The following shows a basic
example with a dynamic rigid-body falling on the ground.

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/getting_started.ts' marker='basic_sim' />
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```js
<load path='/3d/javascript/src/snippets/getting_started.ts' marker='basic_sim' />
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See the `examples2d` and `examples3d` folders for examples on how to initialize a Rapier physics
world using these bindings.

## Using Rapier without a bundler

If you are attempting to use Rapier without a bundler, or if you are using a bundler that doesn't support WASM
files properly, the previous solution will be difficult to get working. The alternative is to use our compatibility
UMD packages `@dimforge/rapier2d-compat` or `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat`. These packages embed the WASM file (encoded
in base64) into the main `JS` file. This results in a slightly different initialization process:

<Tabs
  groupId="dim"
  defaultValue="2D"
  values={[
    {label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
    {label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="2D">

```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/standalone.js' marker='NoBundler' />
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3D">

```js
<load path='/3d/javascript/src/snippets/standalone.js' marker='NoBundler' />
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

A complete example can be found [on codepen](https://codepen.io/sebcrozet/pen/poRQoKK).

## Rendering Debug Shapes

Rapier does not come with any built-in rendering capabilities, so you must do the rendering yourself. However, the debug shape data
can be accessed directly from the physics world instance by calling `debugRender()`.

```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/graphics/Graphics.ts' marker='Debug0' />
```

These are each flat arrays filled with shape and color data for every body and collider in the physics world.

The `vertices` array contains point data of where to draw lines while the `colors` array contains the RGBA values to associate
with each line.

:::info
The colors of each body are not configurable in the current version of Rapier. The colors given will
be based on the type of the given rigid body or collider and the current kinematic state of it.
:::

Below is an example of rendering this data using Pixi.js and Pixi Viewport.

```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/graphics/Graphics.ts' marker='Debug1' />
```
```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/graphics/Graphics.ts' marker='Debug2' />
```

An example of this in action can be see in the [Rapier.js testbed code](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier.js/blob/master/testbed2d/src/Graphics.ts).
