Gravity is such a common force that it is implemented as a special case (even if it could easily be implemented
by the user using [force application](#forces-and-impulses)). <rapier>The gravity is given as an argument to the
`PhysicsPipeline::step` method and can be modified at will by simply modifying that argument.</rapier><bevy>The gravity
is given by the field `RapierConfiguration::gravity` of the resource `RapierConfiguration` and can be modified at
will.</bevy><js>The gravity is given to the constructor of the physics `World`. It can be modified by modifying the
field `World.gravity`.</js> Note however that a change of gravity won't automatically wake-up the
[sleeping bodies](#sleeping) so keep in mind that you may want to wake them up manually before a gravity change.

:::note
Because fixed and kinematic bodies are immune to forces, they are not affected by gravity.

:::info
A rigid-body with no mass will not be affected by gravity either. So if your rigid-body
doesn't fall when you expected it to, make sure it has a mass set explicitly, or has at least one collider with
non-zero density attached to it.
:::

It is possible to change the way gravity affects a specific rigid-body by setting the rigid-body's **gravity scale**
to a value other than `1.0`. The magnitude of the gravity applied to this body will be multiplied by this scaling
factor. Therefore, a gravity scale set to `0.0` will disable gravity for the rigid-body whereas a gravity scale set to
`2.0` will make it twice as strong. A negative value will flip the direction of the gravity for this rigid-body.

This gravity scale factor can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:

<rapier>

```rust
/* Set the gravity scale when the rigid-body is created. */
let rigid_body = RigidBodyBuilder::dynamic()
    // Divide by 2 the strength of gravity for this rigid-body.
    .gravity_scale(0.5)
    .build();
```
```rust
/* Set the gravity scale after the rigid-body creation. */
let rigid_body = rigid_body_set.get_mut(rigid_body_handle).unwrap();
// The `true` argument makes sure the rigid-body is awake.
rigid_body.set_gravity_scale(0.5, true);
assert_eq!(rigid_body.gravity_scale(), 0.5);
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
/* Set the gravity scale when the rigid-body is created. */
commands.spawn()
    .insert(RigidBody::Dynamic)
    .insert(GravityScale(2.0));
```
```rust
/* Set the gravity scale inside of a system. */
fn modify_body_gravity_scale(mut grav_scale: Query<&mut GravityScale>) {
    for mut grav_scale in grav_scale.iter_mut() {
        grav_scale.0 = 2.0;
    }
}
```

<js>

```js
/* Set the gravity scale when the rigid-body is created. */
let rigidBodyDesc = RAPIER.RigidBodyDesc.dynamic()
    .setGravityScale(2.0);
let rigidBody = world.createRigidBody(rigidBodyDesc);
```
```js
/* Set the gravity scale after the rigid-body creation. */
rigidBody.setGravityScale(2.0, true);
```
