Restitution controls how **elastic** (aka. __bouncy__) a contact is. The elasticity of a contact is controlled
by the **restitution coefficient**. A restitution coefficient set to 1 (fully elastic contact) implies that the
exit velocity at a contact has the same magnitude as the entry velocity along the contact normal: it is as if you drop a
bouncing ball and it gets back to the same height after the bounce. A restitution coefficient set ot 0 implies that the
exit velocity at a contact will be zero along the contact normal: it's as if you drop a ball but it doesn't bounce atall.

:::note
The friction and restitution coefficients are both managed in very similar ways: with the `CoefficientCombineRule`
or with [contact modification](advanced_collision_detection#contact-modification). The paragraph bellow is almost identical to the paragraph about [friction](#friction).
:::

Each collider has its own restitution coefficient. This means that when two colliders are in contact, we need to apply a
rule that combines the restitution  coefficients of these two colliders into a single coefficient that will be used for
the contact. This rule is described by the `CoefficientCombineRule` enum:
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Average`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Average`</js>: the average of the two coefficients is used for the contact.
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Min`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Min`</js>: the minimum among the two coefficients is used for the contact.
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Multiply`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Multiply`</js>: the product of the two coefficients is used for the contact.
- <notjs>`CoefficientCombineRule::Max`</notjs><js>`CoefficientCombineRule.Max`</js>: the maximum among the two coefficients is used for the contact.

By default, the `Average` rule is used. Each collider can be given its own restitution combine rule. When two colliders are in
contact, we need to select one of their combine rule. The following precedence is used: `Max > Multiply > Min > Average`.

For example if one collider with the `Multiply` restitution combine rule is in contact with a collider with the `Average` restitution
combine rule, then the `Multiply` rule will be applied for the restitution coefficient of this contact (i.e. the coefficients
of both colliders will be multiplied to obtain the coefficient used by the contact).

:::info
The `CoefficientCombineRule` system exists to cover a wide variety of use-cases efficiently. If this is not flexible
enough, it is possible to get  full control over the selection of restitution coefficients for each contact point using
[contact modification](advanced_collision_detection#contact-modification). For example, contact modification allows the
simulation of colliders with non-uniform restitution coefficients.

The restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule can both be set when the collider is created or after its creation:

<rapier>

```rust
/* Set the restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule
  when the collider is created. */
let collider = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
    .restitution(0.7)
    .restitution_combine_rule(CoefficientCombineRule::Min)
    .build();
```
```rust
/* Set the restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule
   after the collider creation. */
let collider = collider_set.get_mut(collider_handle).unwrap();
collider.set_restitution(0.7);
collider.set_restitution_combine_rule(CoefficientCombineRule::Min);
assert_eq!(collider.restitution(), 0.7);
assert_eq!(collider.restitution_combine_rule(), CoefficientCombineRule::Min);
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
/* Set the restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule
   when the collider is created. */
commands.spawn()
    .insert(Collider::ball(0.5))
    .insert(Restitution {
        coefficient: 0.7,
        combine_rule: CoefficientCombineRule::Min,
    });
```
```rust
/* Set the restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule
   inside of a system. */
fn modify_collider_restitution(mut restitutions: Query<&mut Restitution>) {
    for mut restitution in restitutions.iter_mut() {
        restitution.coefficient = 0.7;
        restitution.combine_rule = CoefficientCombineRule::Min;
    }
}
```

</bevy>
<js>

```js
/* Set the restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule
  when the collider is created. */
let colliderDesc = RAPIER.ColliderDesc.ball(0.5)
    .setRestitution(0.7)
    .setRestitutionCombineRule(RAPIER.CoefficientCombineRule.Min);
let collider = world.createCollider(colliderDesc);
```
```js
/* Set the restitution coefficient and restitution combine rule
   after the collider creation. */
collider.setRestitution(0.7);
collider.setRestitutionCombineRule(RAPIER.CoefficientCombineRule.Min);
