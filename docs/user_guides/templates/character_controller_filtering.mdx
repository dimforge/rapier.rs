It is possible to let the character controller ignore some obstacles. This is achieved by configuring the
`filter` argument of the `KinematicCharacterController::move_shape` method. This `QueryFilter` structure is detailed
in the [scene query filters](scene_queries#query-filters) section.

:::warning
If the character-controller is used to move a collider (and the rigid-body it may be attached to) that is present
in the physics scene, the filters **must** be used to exclude that collider (and that rigid-body) from the set of
obstacles (with `QueryFilter::exclude_collider` and `QueryFilter::exclude_rigid_body`) to prevent the character from
colliding with itself.

It is possible to let the character controller ignore some obstacles. This is achieved by configuring the
`KinematicCharacterController::filter_flags` to exclude whole families of obstacles (e.g. all the colliders
attached to dynamic rigid-bodies), and `KinematicCharacterController::filter_groups` to filter based
on the colliders [collision groups](colliders#collision-groups-and-solver-groups).

<js>

It is possible to let the character controller ignore some obstacles. This can be achieved by setting the
optional arguments of the `KinematicCharacterController.computeColliderMovement` method:
- `filterFlags`: to exclude whole families of obstacles (e.g. all the colliders attached to dynamic rigid-bodies).
- `filterGroups`: filter based on the colliders [collision groups](colliders#collision-groups-and-solver-groups).
- `filterPredicate`: an arbitrary closure to filter-out colliders based on user-defined rules.
