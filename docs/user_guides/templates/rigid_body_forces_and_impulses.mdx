In addition to [gravity](./rigid_body_forces_and_impulses.mdx#gravity), it is possible to add custom forces (or torques) or apply impulses (or torque impulses)
to dynamic rigid-bodies in order to make  them move in specific ways. Forces affect the rigid-body's acceleration
whereas impulses affect the rigid-body's velocity. They are both based on the familiar equations:
- **Forces:** the acceleration change is equal to the force divided by the mass: $\Delta{}a = m^{-1}f$
- **Impulses:** the velocity change is equal to the impulse divided by the mass: $\Delta{}v = m^{-1}i$

Forces can be added, and impulses can be applied, to a rigid-body <rapier>after it has been created</rapier><bevy>when it is created or after
its creation</bevy><js>after it has been created</js>. Added forces are persistent across simulation steps, and can be
cleared manually.

:::info
Keep in mind that a dynamic rigid-body with a zero mass won't be affected by a linear force/impulse, and a rigid-body with a zero
angular inertia won't be affected by torques/torque impulses. So if your force doesn't appear to do anything, make sure that:
1. The rigid-body is dynamic.
2. It is strong enough to make the rigid-body move (try a very large value and see if it does something).
3. The rigid-body has a non-zero mass or angular inertia either because they were set explicitly, or because they
   were computed automatically from colliders with non-zero densities.

<rapier>4. The rigid-body is awake (by waking it up manually or setting the last `wake_up` parameter to `true`).</rapier>
