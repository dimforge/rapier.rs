A rigid-body is created by a `RigidBodyBuilder` structure that is based on the builder pattern. Then it needs
to be inserted into the `RigidBodySet` that will be processed by the physics-pipeline or query-pipeline.

:::info
The following example shows several setters that can be called to customize the
rigid-body being built. The input values are just random so using this example
as-is will not lead to a useful result.

defaultValue="2D"
values={[
{label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
{label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},

All the properties are optional. The only calls that are required are `RigidBodyBuilder::new(status)`,
`RigidBodyBuilder::fixed()`, `RigidBodyBuilder::dynamic()`, `RigidBodyBuilder::kinematic_velocity_based()`,
or `RigidBodyBuilder::kinematic_position_based()`, to
initialize the builder, and `.build()` to actually build the rigid-body.

A rigid-body is created by adding the `RigidBody` component to an entity. Other components
like `Transform`, `Velocity`, `Ccd`, etc. can be added for further customization of the
rigid-body.

A rigid-body is created by a `World.createRigidBody` method. The initial state of
the rigid-body to create is described by an instance of the `RigidBodyDesc` class.

Each rigid-body create by the physics world is given an integer identifier `rigidBody.handle`. This identifier
is guaranteed to the different from any identifier of rigid-bodies still existing (or that existed) in the physics
world.

:::info
Typically, the inertia and center of mass are automatically set to the inertia and center of mass resulting from the
shapes of the [colliders](./rigid_body_creation_and_insertion.mdx#colliders) attached to the rigid-body. But they can also be set manually.
