A rigid-body is created by a `RigidBodyBuilder` structure that is based on the builder pattern. Then it needs
to be inserted into the `RigidBodySet` that will be processed by the physics-pipeline or query-pipeline.

:::info
The following example shows several setters that can be called to customize the
rigid-body being built. The input values are just random so using this example
as-is will not lead to a useful result.

defaultValue="2D"
values={[
{label: 'Example 2D', value: '2D'},
{label: 'Example 3D', value: '3D'},

All the properties are optional. The only calls that are required are `RigidBodyBuilder::new(status)`,
`RigidBodyBuilder::fixed()`, `RigidBodyBuilder::dynamic()`, `RigidBodyBuilder::kinematic_velocity_based()`,
or `RigidBodyBuilder::kinematic_position_based()`, to
initialize the builder, and `.build()` to actually build the rigid-body.

A rigid-body is created by adding the `RigidBody` component to an entity. Other components
like `Transform`, `Velocity`, `Ccd`, etc. can be added for further customization of the
rigid-body.

A rigid-body is created by a `World.createRigidBody` method. The initial state of
the rigid-body to create is described by an instance of the `RigidBodyDesc` class.

Each rigid-body create by the physics world is given an integer identifier `rigidBody.handle`. This identifier
is guaranteed to the different from any identifier of rigid-bodies still existing (or that existed) in the physics
world.

Typically, the inertia and center of mass are automatically set to the inertia and center of mass resulting from the
shapes of the [colliders](#colliders) attached to the rigid-body. But they can also be set manually.
