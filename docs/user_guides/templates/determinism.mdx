By default, Rapier is **locally deterministic**, meaning that running the exact same simulation (with the **same initial
conditions**) twice with the same machine, using the same version of Rapier, and the same version of the Rust compiler,
will result in the exact same simulation results. However, doing this on two different computers may result in
completely different results.

:::note
Two simulations run with the **same initial conditions** if all the [simulation structures](./simulation_structures.mdx) are
initialized with the same values, rigid-bodies/colliders/joints are constructed the same way, and they are added/removed
to sets (rigid-body sets, etc.) in the exact same order.

It is possible to make Rapier **cross-platform deterministic**, meaning that running a simulation with two different
computers (including different OS and/or different processors) will result in the exact same results. In order to
achieve this, both computers must start the simulation with the **same initial conditions** as discussed above, and the
following additional conditions must be met:
- The `enhanced-determinism` feature of Rapier is enabled. Note that the `enhanced-determinism` feature cannot be
  enabled at the same time as the `simd-nightly`, `simd-stable`, and `parallel` features.
- The target platforms must strictly comply to the IEEE 754-2008 floating-points standard. This ensures that
  floating-point computations behave the same on all platforms. This include most modern mainstream processors
  as well as WASM targets.
- If some of the values used to initialized Rapier structures are computed using floating points functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.) other
  than addition/subtraction/multiplication/division, then you need to make sure the functions being used originate from
  the `ComplexField` or `RealField` traits from `nalgebra`. For example, do `ComplexField::sin(0.4)` (where `ComplexField` is imported
  by `use nalgebra::ComplexField`) instead of `0.4.sin()`:
  
```rust
<load path='/3d/rust/examples/rs_determinism.rs' marker='Determinism' />
```

The WASM/Typescript/JavaScript version of Rapier is fully cross-platform deterministic. This means that running the same simulation
(with the **same initial conditions**) using the same version of Rapier, on two different machines (even with different
browsers, operating systems, and processors, will give the exact same results. In particular, creating a snapshot of the
`World` with `world.createSnapshot()` and taking a MD5 hash of the resulting byte array will return the exact same hash
on different machines (assuming the snapshot itself is taken after the same number of timesteps).

:::note
Two simulations run with the **same initial conditions** if all the simulation parameters are initialized with the same
values, rigid-bodies/colliders/joints are constructed the same way, and they are added/removed in the exact same order.
:::

Keep in mind that all the values used to initialize the physics simulation must result from cross-platform
deterministic operations to in order to preserve the determinism of the physics engine itself. Otherwise, you won't
get the exact same initial conditions on all the platforms. In particular, transcendental functions like
`Math.sin, Math.cos` are not cross-platform determinism and may give different results on different platforms.
