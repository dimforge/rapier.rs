## My local build of Rapier is slower than the online demos
Make sure you are building your project (or just the Rapier dependency) in release mode, e.g., `cargo build --release`.
Rapier can be 100 times slower without optimizations enabled. Keep in mind that it is possible to compile your project
without optimizations while keeping optimizations enabled for Rapier itself:

<rapier>

```toml
# Add this to your Cargo.toml
[profile.dev.package.rapier3d]
opt-level = 3
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```toml
# Add this to your Cargo.toml
[profile.dev.package.bevy_rapier3d]
opt-level = 3
```

</bevy>

See the [cargo book about profile overrides](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#overrides) for
details about this technique.

:::info
Also note that setting the number codegen units to 1 will further improve performances in a noticeable way, even for a
release build (though the build itself will take longer to complete):
```toml
# Add this to your Cargo.toml
[profile.release]
codegen-units = 1
```

## Rigid-body isn't affected by gravity
If you expect your rigid-body to fall because of gravity but it doesn't, please make sure to double-check
the following:
- Your gravity vector is non-zero.
- Your rigid-body is a dynamic rigid-body.
- You didn't lock the translations of the rigid-body.
- The rigid-body has a non-zero mass.

Note that a collider not attached to a dynamic rigid-body will never fall because it won't be affected by forces.
  
:::note
If the rigid-body has no collider attached to it, its mass will be zero unless you gave it a mass (or mass properties)
explicitly. If the rigid-body has colliders attached to it and you didn't give the rigid-body a mass explicitly, make
sure that at least one of the colliders has a non-zero density (or non-zero mass if you set it explicitly on the
collider).
:::
:::warning
Currently, colliders with triangle-meshes won't have their mass properties computed automatically. So if a rigid-body
only has triangle-mesh colliders attached to it, you need to set its mass/angular inertia manually.

## Applying a force to a rigid-body doesn't work
If applying a force or an impulse to a rigid-body doesn't work, please make sure to double-check the following:

<rapier>

- The rigid-body is a dynamic rigid-body.
- The rigid-body has a non-zero mass (or non-zero angular inertia for torques).
- The force or impulse must be strong enough to actually push the rigid-body. You may for example try with a very
      high force/impulse value (say, with a magnitude of `100_000.0`) and see if this stronger force works.
- The rigid-body is [awake](rigid_bodies#sleeping), either by calling `RigidBody::wake_up(true)` explicitly, or by using `true` as the
  last argument of the force/impulse application method.
  
</rapier>

## The simulation panics!
It may happen that Rapier panics with the following panic message:
```rust
"assertion failed: proxy.aabb.maxs[dim] >= self.min_bound"
```
This panics generally means that something went wrong in the simulation, resulting in `NaN` values appearing in the
collider positions. The most common configuration that makes this panic happen is if two dynamic rigid-bodies with 
a zero mass start being in contact. To fix this, make sure that your dynamic rigid-bodies have a non-zero mass.

:::note
If the rigid-body has no collider attached to it, its mass will be zero unless you gave it a mass (or mass properties)
explicitly. If the rigid-body has colliders attached to it and you didn't give the rigid-body a mass explicitly, make
sure that at least one of the colliders has a non-zero density (or non-zero mass if you set it explicitly on the
collider).

## Why is everything moving in slow-motion?
A common mistake, especially in 2D, is to use pixels as the length unit in the physics world. Let's say that in 2D
you have a 100x100 pixels sprite for your player. It may be tempting to use a 100x100 cuboid collider for this
sprite: <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::cuboid(50.0, 50.0)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::cuboid(50.0, 50.0)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.cuboid(50.0, 50.0)`</js> (we set `50.0`
because this is the half-width of the cuboid). Doing this will make it look like the simulation runs in __slow-motion__
because the cuboid will be huge compared to the magnitude of the default gravity (-9.81).

The recommended way of using Rapier is to use [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units)
(meters, seconds, kilograms, etc.) If the player sprite is a 100x100 cuboid, then it is as if your player is 100 meters
tall and 100 meters wide, which is huge. Therefore it is recommended to have a scaling factor between the graphics
and the physics. For example we can say that 1 physics meter is equal to 50 pixels. This means that we can
initialize our player collider as a 2x2 cuboid while still using a 100x100 pixels sprite.

<rapier>

All we need to do to keep measures in sync is to multiply by our scaling factor 50 all the positions given by the
physics engine before rendering:

```rust
// Scale the translation to convert from meters to pixels
sprite.set_translation(rigid_body.translation() * 50.0);
// Rotation angles don't need to be scaled
sprite.set_rotation(rigid_body.rotation().angle());
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

In this example, we could set `RapierPhysicsPlugin::pixels_per_meter(50.0)` so that while all the transforms,
collider size, positions, etc. are expressed in pixels on your end, `bevy_rapier` will automatically divide
them by 50.0 whenever it inputs/reads data into/from Rapier itself.
