The most efficient way of preventing some pairs of colliders from interacting with each other is to use collision
groups or solver groups. Each collider is given:
- A `collision_groups` for filtering what pair of colliders should have their contacts (or intersection test if
  at least one of the colliders is a sensor) computed by the narrow-phase.
  This filtering happens right after the broad-phase, at the beginning of the narrow phase.
- A `solver_groups` for filtering what pair of colliders should have their contact forces computed. This filtering
  happens at the end of the narrow-phase, before the constraints solver

In other words, the `solver_groups` is here to prevent contact forces from being computed between some colliders, whereas the
`collision_groups` will also prevent the contact themselves (and contact events) from being computed. The
`collision_groups` should be preferred most of the time because it skips more computations. The `solver_groups` is only
useful if you really want the contact information to be computed but not the forces, for example so that you can apply your
own forces based on these contacts.

A collision group or solver group is described as a pair of bit masks:
- The groups **membership** indicates what groups the collider is part of (one bit per group).
- The groups **filter** indicates what groups the collider can interact with (one bit per group).

<notjs>

:::info
Because the `membership` and `filter` bit masks are `u32` there is a total of 32 groups. By default all bits are set to
1: the collider is part of every group, and can interact with every group.
:::

</notjs>
<js>

The `membership` and `filter` are both 16-bit bit masks packed into a single 32-bits value. The 16 left-most bits
contain the memberships whereas the 16 right-most bits contain the filter.

</js>

For example, let's say we want our collider `A` to be part of the groups `[0, 2, 3]` and to be able to interact
with the groups `[2]`, then its groups membership is <notjs>`0b1101` and its groups filter is
`0b0100`.</notjs> <js>`0b0000_0000_0000_1101 = 0x000D` and its groups filter is `0b0000_0000_0000_0100 = 0x0004`. The
corresponding packed bit mask is `0x000D0004`.</js> The collision groups and solver groups of a collider can be set 
during or after its creation:

<rapier>

```rust
/* Set the collision groups and solver groups when the collider is created. */
let collider = ColliderBuilder::ball(0.5)
    .collision_groups(InteractionGroups::new(0b1101.into(), 0b0100.into())
    .solver_groups(InteractionGroups::new(0b0011.into(), 0b1011.into())
    .build();
```
```rust
/* Set the collision groups and solver groups after the collider creation. */
let collider = collider_set.get_mut(collider_handle).unwrap();
collider.set_collision_groups(InteractionGroups::new(0b1101.into(), 0b0100.into());
collider.set_solver_groups(InteractionGroups::new(0b0011.into(), 0b1011.into());
assert_eq!(collider.collision_groups(), InteractionGroups::new(0b1101.into(), 0b0100.into());
assert_eq!(collider.solver_groups(), InteractionGroups::new(0b0011.into(), 0b1011.into());
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
/* Set the collision and/or solver groups when the collider is created. */
commands.spawn(Collider::ball(0.5))
    .insert(CollisionGroups::new(0b1101.into(), 0b0100.into())
    .insert(SolverGroups::new(0b0011.into(), 0b1011.into());
```
```rust
/* Set the collision and/or solver groups inside of a system. */
fn modify_collider_groups(mut collision_groups: Query<&mut CollisionGroups>, mut solver_groups: Query<&mut SolverGroups>) {
    for mut collision_groups in flags.iter_mut() {
        collision_groups.memberships = 0b1101.into();
        collision_groups.filters = 0b0100.into();
    }

    for mut solver_groups in flags.iter_mut() {
        solver_groups.memberships = 0b0011.into();
        solver_groups.filters = 0b1011.into();
    }
}
```

</bevy>
<js>

```js
/* Set the collision groups and solver groups when the collider is created. */
let colliderDesc = RAPIER.ColliderDesc.ball(0.5)
    .setCollisionGroups(0x000D0004)
    .setSolverGroups(0x00500010);
let collider = world.createCollider(colliderDesc);
```
```js
/* Set the collision groups and solver groups after the collider creation. */
collider.setCollisionGroups(0x000D0004);
collider.setSolverGroups(0x000D0004);
```

</js>

After the broad-phase detects that two colliders `A` and `B` may start being in contact, the narrow-phase will check the collision
groups of both colliders to see if it needs to compute contacts. The check operates as follows:
- If the collider `A` is not member of any collision group in the filter of `B`, then no contact is computed.
- If the collider `B` is not member of any collision group in the filter of `A`, then no contact is computed.
- The exact bit-wise check is the following:

<notjs>

```rust
   (A.collision_groups().memberships & B.collision_groups().filter) != 0
&& (B.collision_groups().memberships & A.collision_groups().filter) != 0
```

</notjs>
<js>

```rust
   ((A.collisionGroups() >> 16) & (B.collisionGroups() & 0xffff)) != 0
&& ((B.collisionGroups() >> 16) & (A.collisionGroups() & 0xffff)) != 0
```

</js>

If this test succeeds, then the narrow-phase will compute the contacts. Then it will check the solver groups of both
colliders, using the same kind of tests as described before but using the `solver_groups` instead of `collision_groups`.
If the test succeeds then the constraints solver will compute forces for these contacts. Otherwise, it won't.
