Colliders represent the geometric shapes that generate contacts and collision events when they touch.
Attaching one or multiple colliders to a rigid body allow the rigid-body to be affected by contact forces.

## Shapes
### Overview
The main characteristic of a collider is its geometric shape. The supported shapes are illustrated bellow:

![supported shapes](/img/supported_shapes.svg)

Shapes only hold information about their geometry. Their world-space position is given by the collider's position.
Balls, cuboids, capsules, cylinders, and cones are all described by their half-height and/or radius. Compound shapes,
convex meshes, triangle meshes, heightfields, and polylines are more complicated shapes described in the next paragraphs. 

### Convex meshes
A convex mesh is a shape such that, if two points are part of the shape, then the segment between these two points is
also part of the shape:

![convex versus non-convex](/img/convex_concave_crossing.svg)

There are two ways of creating a collider with a convex shape:
1. Using <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::convex_hull(points)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::convex_hull(points)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.convexHull(points)`</js>. This is the simplest approach: it will automatically compute the convex
   hull of the given set of points. A __convex hull__ is the smallest convex shape that contains all the given points.
2. Using <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::convex_mesh(points, indices)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::convex_mesh(points, indices)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.convexMesh(points, indices)`</js> in
   3D or <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::convex_polyline(points)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::convex_polyline(points)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.convexPolyline(points)`</js> in 2D.
   This takes a mesh described by its vertex buffer and index
   buffer and assumes it is already convex (you need to ensure that it is convex yourself). This will be more efficient than
   the <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::convex_hull`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::convex_hull`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.convexHull`</js> constructor because it
   won't perform any calculations to ensure convexity. However, if the input mesh isn't actually convex, the collision-detection
   for that shape will give an incorrect result.
   
### Triangle meshes and polylines
Triangle meshes (in 3D) and polylines (in 2D) can be used to describe the boundary of any kind of shape. This is
generally useful to describe the  fixed environment in games (terrains, buildings, etc.)  Triangle meshes and
polylines are defined  by their vertex buffer and  their index buffer. The winding of the triangles of a triangle mesh
does not matter. Its topology doesn't matter either (it can have holes, cavities, doesn't need to be closed or
manifold). It is however strongly recommended to avoid triangles that are long and thin because they can result in a
lower numerical stability of collision-detection.

:::note
A triangle mesh/polyline is composed of triangles/segments with no thickness. This means that geometric queries like
point-containment tests won't work intuitively because the triangle mesh is assumed to have no interior.
:::

#### Triangle mesh

A **triangle-mesh** collider can be built
with <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::trimesh(vertices, indices)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::trimesh(vertices, indices)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.trimesh(vertices, indices)`</js> where
`vertices` is the buffer containing all the vertices of the mesh, and `indices` is a set of indices indicating what vertex is used by
what triangle. The vertex buffer and index buffer may have different lengths, and any vertex can be shared
by multiple triangles.

To have more control over the resulting `Trimesh`,
<rapier>you can call `ColliderBuilder::trimesh_with_flags(vertices, indices, trimesh_flags)`.</rapier>
<bevy>you can call `Collider::trimesh_with_flags(vertices, indices, trimesh_flags)`.</bevy>
<js>you can call `ColliderDesc.trimesh` with a third optional parameter `trimeshFlags`.</js>

For example, `TrimeshFlags::FIX_INTERNAL_EDGES` is a popular choice to help with correcting ghost collision.

See [`TriMeshFlags` documentation](https://docs.rs/rapier2d/latest/rapier2d/geometry/struct.TriMeshFlags.html) for more information.

#### Polyline

A **polyline** collider can be built
with <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::polyline(vertices, indices)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::polyline(vertices, indices)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.polyline(vertices, indices)`</js> where
`vertices` is the buffer containing all the vertices of the polyline, and `indices` is an optional set of indices
indicating what vertex is used by what segment. The vertex buffer and index buffer may have different lengths, and any
vertex can be shared by multiple segments. If the given vertex buffer is `None` then the input vertices are assumed to
form a line strip, i.e., the polyline is formed from the  segments `[vertices[0], vertices[1]], [vertices[1], vertices[2]], etc.`

:::warning
It is discouraged to use a triangle meshes or a polylines for colliders attached to
dynamic rigid-bodies. Because they have no interior, it is easy for another object to get stuck into them.
In order to simulate properly non-convex objects, it is recommended to use a **convex decomposition** with a
[compound shape](./colliders.mdx#compound-shapes) instead.
:::

### Heightfields

![heightfield](/img/heightfield.svg)

Heightfields are a more restrictive version of triangle-meshes and polylines. However, they can be easier to define
and use much less memory. Therefore heightfields are useful to define large parts of terrains with simple topologies.

A **3D heightfield** is basically large rectangle in the `X-Z` plane, subdivided in a grid pattern at regular intervals. Each
vertex of this subdivision is given a height, i.e., the coordinate of that point along the `Y` axis. A 3D heightfield
collider can be created
with <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::heightfield(heights, scale)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::heightfield(heights, scale)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.heightfield(heights, scale)`</js> where
`heights` is a matrix indicating the altitude of each subdivision point of that heightfield. The number of rows of that
matrix is the number of subdivision along the `X` axis, and the number of columns is the number of subdivision along the
`Z` axis. The `scale` argument indicates the size of the rectangle of the `X-Z` plane.

:::info
A heightfield collider can be given any orientation by changing the orientation of the collider itself.
:::

A **2D heightfield** is a large segment along the `X` axis, subdivided at regular intervals. Each vertex of this
subdivision is given a height, i.e., the coordinate of that point along the `Y` axis. A 2D heightfield collider
can be created
with <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::heightfield(heights, scale)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::heightfield(heights, scale)`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.heightfield(heights, scale)`</js> where
`heights` is a vector indicating the altitude of each subdivision point of that heightfield. The number of elements on
that vector is the number of subdivision of the heightfield. The `scale` argument indicates the length of the subdivided
segment along the `X` axis.

<!-- TODO: add illustrations + cover the heightfield subdivision pattern and holes. -->

### Compound shapes
It is not recommended to use a triangle mesh or polyline for the shape of a collider attached to a dynamic rigid-body.
The alternative is to use a compound shape to model a non-convex object as the union of multiple convex parts (which can
be cuboids, balls, convex meshes, etc.) This is commonly known as a **convex decomposition**.

:::info
An alternative to using a **compound shape** is to attach **multiple colliders** to the same rigid-body: all the colliders
will move with the rigid-body automatically, behaving in a very similar way than using a single collider with a
compound shape. The main differences between the two approaches is about collision events: each collider generates
individual collision start/stop events.
:::

To build a compound shape, it is possible to directly provide the set of shapes as well as their position in the
compound shape's local space:

<rapier>

```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_colliders2.rs' marker='Compound' />
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/colliders_compound2.rs' marker='ColliderCompound' />
```

</bevy>

It is also possible to build a compound shape modelling the convex decomposition of a 3D triangle mesh or 2D polyline
using the <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::convex_decomposition(vertices, indices)`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::convex_decomposition(vertices, indices)`</bevy>
method. This will automatically create a compound shape
composed of multiple convex meshes obtained from the approximate convex decomposition of the triangle mesh (or polyline in 2D)
using the [VHACD algorithm](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd). Here are examples of a 2D concave polygon decomposed into two
convex parts as well as a 3D mesh with its approximate convex decomposition composed of 7 convex parts:

![convex decomposition](/img/convex_decomposition.png)

### Round shapes
Some shapes have __round__ variants: `RoundCuboid`, `RoundCylinder`, `RoundCone`, `RoundConvexPolygon` and
`RoundConvexPolyhedron`. These are shapes to which is added a small thickness with round border:

<p align="center">
    <img src="/img/round_cuboid.svg" alt="round cuboid"/>
</p>

:::note
For algorithmic reasons, collision-detection involving **round cylinders**, **round cones**, **round convex polygon** or
**round convex polyhedron** will be faster than collision-detection with their non-round counterparts. However,
collision-detection with **round-cuboids** will be slower than collision-detection with regular cuboids.
:::

Colliders with round shapes are built in a way very similar to their non-round
counterparts, e.g., <rapier>`ColliderBuilder::round_cuboid`</rapier><bevy>`Collider::round_cuboid`</bevy><js>`ColliderDesc.roundCuboid`</js>.
These constructors take one additional parameter: the size of the added thickness called <notjs>`border_radius`</notjs><js>`borderRadius`</js>.

## User-data
Each collider can be given a user-defined data of type `u128`. This integer can have any value
and is never used/modified by the physics-engine. This can for example be useful to add some custom data for personalized
[contact filtering/modification](./advanced_collision_detection.mdx).

This user-data can be set when the collider is created or after its creation:

```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_colliders2.rs' marker='UserData1' />
```
```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_colliders2.rs' marker='UserData2' />
```
