Scene queries are geometric queries that take all the colliders of the physics world into account. These queries are
available through the <rapier>[QueryPipeline](./simulation_structures.mdx#query-pipeline)</rapier><bevy>`RapierQueryPipeline` component</bevy><js>`World` class</js>.

<rapier>

Keep in mind that scene queries will only take into account the colliders (and their positions) known during the
last call to `QueryPipeline::update`:

```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_scene_queries2.rs' marker='Update' />
```

If you need to avoid an expensive full rebuild, it is possible to update only specific changes:

```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_scene_queries2.rs' marker='UpdateIncremental' />
```
