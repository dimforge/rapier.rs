Most games involve bodies behaving in ways that defy the laws of physics: floating platforms, elevators,
playable characters, etc. This is why **kinematic bodies** exist: they offer a total control over the body’s trajectory
since they are completely immune to forces or impulses (like gravity, contacts, joints).

But this control comes at a price: it is up to the user to take any obstacle into account by running custom
collision-detection operations manually and update the trajectory accordingly. This can be very difficult. Detecting
obstacles usually rely on [ray-casting](scene_queries#ray-casting) or [shape-casting](scene_queries#shape-casting), used
to adjust the trajectory based on the potential contact normals. Often, multiple ray or shape-casts are needed, and the
trajectory adjustment code isn’t straightforward.

The **Kinematic Character Controller** (which we will abbreviate to **_character controller_**) is a higher-level tool
that will emit the proper ray-casts and shape-casts to adjust the user-defined trajectory based on obstacles. The
well-known _move-and-slide_ operation is the main feature of a character controller.

:::note
Despite its name, a character controller can also be used for moving objects that are not characters. For example, a
character controller may be used to move a platform. In the rest of this guide, we will use the word _character_
to designate _whatever you would like to move using the character controller_.

Rapier provides a built-in general-purpose character controller implementation. It allows you to easily:
- Stop at obstacles.
- Slide on slopes that are not to steep.
- Climb stairs automatically.
- Walk over small obstacles.
- Interact with moving platforms.

Despite the fact that this built-in character controller is designed to be generic enough to serve as a good starting
point for many common use-cases, character-control (especially for the player’s character itself) is often very
game-specific. Therefore the builtin character controller may not work perfectly out-of-the-box for all game
types.<notjs> Don’t hesitate to copy and customize it to fit your particular needs.</notjs>

## Gravity
Since you are responsible for providing the movement vector to the character controller at each frame, it is up to
you to emulate gravity by adding a downward component to that movement vector.
