Some projects may require multiple physics contexts. For example, a game with multiple levels may want to have a
different physics context for each level. An AI-training project may want to simulate multiple physics contexts in parallel.

This page explains how to manage multiple physics contexts in Rapier.

## Components

By default, on `PreStartup`, `bevy_rapier` spawns a `RapierContext`, marked by a `DefaultRapierContext` component,
so most users can forget about multiple contexts support and use "easy" accessors such as `ReadDefaultRapierContext`.

If you don't want a default context to be spawned,
you can disable it using `RapierContextInitialization`:

```rust
<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/multiple_contexts.rs' marker='MultipleContexts_no_default' />
```

If you need multiple physics contexts, you can spawn them manually. Here is an example of how to spawn a new
physics context:

```rust
<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/multiple_contexts.rs' marker='MultipleContexts_new' />
```

Any entity managed by a `RapierContext` (colliders, joints, rigidbodies) has a `RapierContextEntityLink` component attached to it. This component
can be used to retrieve its corresponding physics context.

## Resources

`bevy_rapier` uses a `schedule` to parameterize its execution, this means all physics contexts share the same `TimestepMode` resource:

all physics contexts execute at the same time, at the same rate.
