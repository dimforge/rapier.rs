One of the most appealing features of a physics engine is to simulate articulations. Articulations, aka. _joints_, allow
the restriction of the motion of one body relative to another. For example, one well-known joint is the ball-in-socket
joint also known as the ball joint: it allows one object to rotate freely with regard to the other but not to translate.
This is typically used to simulate shoulders of a ragdoll.

## Fundamental concepts

Joints can be modeled in various ways but let's talk about the concept of **Degrees Of Freedom (DOF)** first. In 3D, a
rigid-body is capable of translating along the 3 coordinates axes $\mathbf{x}$, $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{z}$, and to
rotate along those three axes as well. Therefore, a rigid-body is said to have **3 translational DOF** and **3 rotational DOF**.
We can also say a 3D rigid-body has a total of **6 DOF**. The 2D case is similar but with less possibilities of movements:
a 2D rigid-body has 2 translational DOF and only 1 rotational DOF (which forms a total of 3 DOF). The number of **relative DOF**
of a body wrt. another body is the number of possible relative translations and rotations.
The goal of a joint is to reduce the number of DOF a body has. For example, the aforementioned ball joint removes all relative
translations between two bodies. Therefore, it allows only the 3 rotational DOF in 3D simulations or the 1 rotational DOF
in 2D simulations. Other joints exist allowing other combinations of relative DOF. Note that because there are less possible
motions in 2D, some joints are only defined in 3D. This is illustrated by empty cells in the following table for joints
that are not defined in 2D:

| Joint           | Allowed DOF in 2D | Allowed DOF in 3D |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| _Fixed joint_       | None           | None
| _Free joint_        | All            | All
| _Prismatic joint_   | 1 Translation  | 1 Translation |
| _Revolute joint_    | 1 Rotation     | 1 Rotation    |
| _Ball joint_        | 1 Rotation     | 3 Rotations |
| _Cartesian joint_   | 2 Translations | 3 Translations |
| _Planar joint_      |                | 2 Translations + 1 Rotation |
| _Cylindrical joint_ |                | 1 Translation + 1 Rotation (along the same axis) |
| _Pin-slot joint_    |                | 1 Translation + 1 Rotation (along different axes) |
| _Rectangular joint_ |                | 2 Translations |
| _Universal joint_   |                | 2 Rotations |

In 3D, a special _Helical joint_ also exists: it allows only one DOF which is a bit special as it is the combination of
a rotation and a translation. In other words, a body attached to the ground by an helical joint will only be able to translate
and rotate simultaneously: any translation induce automatically a rotation and vice-versa.

-------

In practice, there are two main ways of modeling joints:

1. The **reduced-coordinates approach** encodes the reduction of DOF directly into the equations of motion. For example,
a 3D rigid-body attached to the ground with a revolute joint will have its position encoded by only one variable: the
rotation angle. Therefore, integrating its motion only changes this one variable and doesn't need additional forces or
mathematical constraints to be generated. The clear advantage is that there is no way for the physics engine to apply
any motion other than that single rotation to this body, meaning there is no way the body shifts to a position that is
not realistic, even if the dynamics solver does not converge completely.
2. The **constraints-based approach** (or full-coordinates approach) is the most commonly available approach on other
physics engines for video-games and animations. Here, a 3D rigid-body attached to the ground with a revolute joint will
still have its position encoded by 6 variables (3 for translations and 3 for rotations) just like any rigid-body without
a joint. Then the integrator will add mathematical constraints to the dynamic system to ensure forces are applied to
simulate the reduction of the number of DOF as imposed by the joints. In practice, this means that the rigid-body will
break the joint constraint if the constraint solver does not converge completely.

This description shows only one aspect of the difference between the reduced-coordinates approach and the constraints-based
approach. More generally, the reduced-coordinates approach favors accuracy while the constraints-based approach favors
versatility.

:::warning
Currently, Rapier only implements the constraints-based approach. A reduced-coordinates implementation will be added to
a future version of Rapier.

The following table compares the advantages and limitations of both approaches:

The following schematics illustrate a configuration that can be simulated by a multibody (left assembly with a tree structure),
and one that cannot (right assembly with a graph structure). The assembly on the left models a SCARA robotic arm with 3
rotational DOF (due to three revolute joints) and 1 translational DOF (due to one prismatic joint). The assembly on the
right models a necklace with five pearls. It has a total of 15 rotational DOF (due to five ball joints):

:::note "Which approach should I use?"
The choice of approach **depends on the application**. For **robotics**, the **reduced-coordinates** approach is
generally preferred because of its accuracy and ease of use, e.g., for control, inverse kinematics, etc.

---------

**Video games** traditionally favor the **constraints-based** approach since most existing physics libraries implement
only this. Moreover if joint assemblies are small, and joints are frequently added and removed, the constraints-based
approach will be more efficient. Some other physics libraries implement the reduced-coordinates approach as well but often
using the Featherstone algorithm which is extremely unstable in practice.

---------

Simulating **closed loops** like for a necklace cannot be achieved with the reduced-coordinates approach only. However,
it is possible to combine both approaches by using joint constraints only to close the loops. Refer to the [last section](./advanced_collision_detection.mdx#combining-both)
for details.
:::

The use of the reduced-coordinates approach is detailed in the [multibodies](./advanced_collision_detection.mdx#multibodies) section and demonstrated by
the [Multibody joints](/all_examples3/?multibody) demo. The constraints-based approach is detailed in the
[joint constraints](./advanced_collision_detection.mdx#joint-constraints) section and demonstrated by the [Joint constraints](/all_examples3/?constraints) demo.

## Multibodies
Multibodies implement the reduced-coordinates approach. A multibody is a set of **multibody links** attached together by
a **multibody joint**.


### Creating a multibody
Creating a multibody is done link-by-link using the `MultibodyDesc` structure based on the builder pattern. Each link
of a multibody is described by a single `MultibodyDesc` to which children links can be added by calling the `.add_child`
method. This method will itself return a new `MultibodyDesc` that can be used to initialize the child, create even
more nested children, etc.

The following table summarizes the types corresponding to the joints mentioned at the beginning of this chapter that
can be used for the `MultibodyDesc`:

| Joint name | Multibody joint type on **nphysics** |
|------------|---------|
| _Fixed joint_       | [`FixedJoint`](/rustdoc/nphysics3d/joint/struct.FixedJoint.html)|
| _Prismatic joint_   | [`PrismaticJoint`](/rustdoc/nphysics3d/joint/struct.PrismaticJoint.html)  |
| _Revolute joint_    | [`RevoluteJoint`](/rustdoc/nphysics3d/joint/struct.RevoluteJoint.html)  |
| _Ball joint_        | [`BallJoint`](/rustdoc/nphysics3d/joint/struct.BallJoint.html)     |

| _Universal joint_   | [`UniversalJoint`](/rustdoc/nphysics3d/joint/struct.UniversalJoint.html)   |

:::note
The first multibody link of a multibody is necessarily attached to an implicit fixed ground. Note however that
"attached" is a bit misleading here. Indeed if `joint` is set to an instance of `FreeJoint`, then this first
multibody link will have all the possible degrees of freedom, making it completely free to perform any movement.
:::

:::warning
The `FreeJoint` can be used only by the first link of the multibody otherwise, the creation of the
multibody will panic.
:::

While it is not possible to remove a link from an existing multibody, it is possible to add new links:

```rust
// This will create the multibody links identified by `multibody_desc`
// and all its children. The multibody link identified by `multibody_desc`
// is then attached as a child of the pre-existing multibody link identified
// by `parent_handle`.
multibody_desc.build_with_parent(multibody, link_id);
```

:::note "Multibody link part handles"
The `BodyPartHandle` identifying a specific link of a multibody can be constructed with `BodyPartHandle(handle, i)`
where `handle` is the multibody handle, and `i` designates the `i`-th link of the multibody. Multibody links
are indexed in their creation order.
:::

Alternatively, you may retrieve a reference to a multibody link and its index using its name set during its construction:

```rust
for link in multibody.links_with_name("my multibody link name") {
    /// ...
}
```

You may refer to the [code](https://github.com/rustsim/nphysics/blob/master/examples3d/multibody3.rs) of
[that demo](/all_examples3/?multibody) for concrete examples of multibody creation.

### Removing a multibody
The removal of a multibody from the body set uses the same method as the removal of a rigid-body: `body_set.remove(handle)`.
It is not possible to remove a single link of a multibody without removing the whole multibody altogether.

### Multibody joint limits and motors
It is often desirable to limit the amplitude of movement a multibody link can have with regard to its parent. For
example we might want to limit the minimum and maximum value for the DOF of a prismatic joint in order to simulate a
piston with finite stroke. Or we might want to limit the maximum angle a revolute joint can make with regard to its
parent. Those are modeled by **joint limits**. Joint limits are currently only implemented for multibody joints with
DOF that are independent from each other. Therefore, it is not implemented for the `FreeJoint`, `BallJoint`, and
`CartesianJoint`. All other joints have methods similar to the following:

| Method                 | Description                                                           |
|--                      | --                                                                    |
| `.enable_min_angle(limit)` | Sets the minimum angle (in radians) the joint angular DOF can take. |
| `.enable_max_angle(limit)` |  Sets the maximum angle (in radians) the joint angular DOF can take. |
| `.disable_min_angle()` | Disable the lower angle limit. |
| `.disable_max_angle()` | Disable the upper angle limit. |
| `.enable_min_offset(limit)` | Sets the minimum offset the joint linear DOF can take. |
| `.enable_max_offset(limit)` | Sets the maximum offset the joint linear DOF can take. |
| `.disable_min_offset()` | Disable the lower offset limit. |
| `.disable_max_offset()` | Disable the upper offset limit. |

:::note
Joints with no angular DOF will not have the methods related to the angular limits. Similarly, joints with no linear DOF will not have the methods related to the linear limits. Joints with several angular or linear DOF will have those methods with an index appended to their name, e.g., the `.enable_min_angle_1(limit)` method of an universal joint will enable a lower limit for its first angular DOF.
:::

---------------

It is also often desirable to motorize a joint to impose a movement. For example simulating a motorized car wheel can be achieved by enabling a motor on a revolute joint linking the wheel with the car frame. A motor is specified by a target velocity and a maximum force. **nphysics** will apply forces at the motorized joint so that the joint reaches the target velocity, but will never apply a force that is stronger than some maximum user-defined value. Setting a small maximum force can be useful for having the joint accelerate progressively. In any case, setting a maximum motor force is **highly recommended**.

:::warning
Not setting any maximum force implies that **nphysics** is allowed to generate any force as large as necessary to reach the target velocity in one timestep. This is strongly discouraged because that can lead to odd behaviors. For example if a motorized pendulum with no maximum force hits a wall, the non-penetration constraint due to the contact will have to generate a force that counteracts the effect of the motor force. However this will not be possible given the motor is free to apply any, potentially infinite, force. This can result in the pendulum traversing the wall.
:::

For the moment, joint motors are only implemented for multibody joints with DOF that are independent from each other. Therefore, it is not implemented for `FreeJoint`, `BallJoints`, and `CartesianJoints`. All other joints have methods similar to the following:

| Method                 | Description                                                           |
|--                      | --                                                                    |
| `.enable_angular_motor()` | Activate the angular motor. |
| `.disable_angular_motor()` | Disable the angular motor. |
| `.set_desired_angular_motor_velocity(vel)` | Set the angular velocity the motor must achieve. Setting this to `0.0` is possible and will simulate joint friction. |
| `.set_max_angular_motor_torque(max)` |  Sets the maximum torque the motor can deliver to reach the desired velocity. |
| `.enable_linear_motor()` | Activate the linear motor. |
| `.disable_linear_motor()` | Disable the linear motor. |
| `.set_desired_linear_motor_velocity(vel)` | Set the velocity the motor must achieve. Setting this to `0.0` is possible and will simulate joint friction. |
| `.set_max_linear_motor_force(max)` |  Sets the maximum linear force the motor can deliver to reach the desired velocity. |

:::note
Joints with no angular DOF will not have the methods related to the angular motors. Similarly, joints with no linear DOF will not have the methods related to the linear motors. Joints with several angular or linear DOF will have those methods with an index appended to their name, e.g., the `.enable_angular_motor_1()` method of an universal joint will enable a motor for its first angular DOF.

## Joint constraints
Joint constraints implement the constraints-based approach. The following table summarizes the types corresponding to the joints mentioned at the beginning of this chapter:

| Joint name | Joint constraint type on **Rapier** |
|------------|---------|
| _Fixed joint_       | `dynamics::FixedJoint` |
| _Prismatic joint_   | `dynamics::PrismaticJoint`     |
| _Revolute joint_    | `dynamics::RevoluteJoint`    |
| _Ball joint_        | `dynamics::BallJoint` |

<!--
| _Cartesian joint_   | `dynamics::CartesianJoint`    |
| _Planar joint_      | `dynamics::PlanarJoint`     |
| _Cylindrical joint_ | `dynamics::CylindricalJoint`      |
| _Pin-slot joint_    | `dynamics::PinSlotJoint`    |
| _Rectangular joint_ | `dynamics::RectangularJoint`   |
| _Universal joint_   | `dynamics::UniversalJoint`     |
-->

:::note
Other joints will be added in the future.
:::

A joint constraint geometry is completely configured at its creation, and added to the joint set by the
`joint_set.insert(&mut bodies, body1, body2, joint, true)` method by specifying the handles of the bodies the joint is
attached to.

<!--
## Combining both
Combining multibodies and joint constraints is a useful way of combining the stability of multibodies with the flexibility of joint constraints. Indeed, one of the most appealing features of a multibody is its stability and ease of use (especially for robotics). However its greatest weakness is its inability to represent assemblies that do not match a tree structure, i.e., an articulated body composed of graph-like assembly of solids (each graph node being a solid and each graph edge being an articulation) cannot be simulated by a multibody. A common approach is thus to:

1. Define a multibody from a spanning-tree of the graph.
2. Create joint constraints for each articulation missing from this multibody to complete the graph. Those joint constraints are therefore attached to two multibody links. They are often called "loop-closing constraints" since they close the loops of the assembly's graph structure.

The following shows an example of combination of multibodies and joint constraints for the simulation of a necklace. It is composed of 5 pearls forming a single loop attached together by 5 ball joints. Since such a loop cannot be simulated by a multibody, we first start to create 5 multibody links attached together with 4 `BallJoint`. Only 4 joints can be added here since a 5th would close the loop.
The 5th joint that closes the loop must be modeled as a joint constraint, here a `BallConstraint` between the first and the last link:

<center>

:::note
Note that using the world to create multibody links removes any risk of inadvertently creating multibody links attached in such a way that they would form anything but a tree structure.
