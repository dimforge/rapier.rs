The [mass properties of a rigid-body](rigid_bodies#mass-properties) is computed as the sum of the mass-properties
manually set by the user for the rigid-body, plus the **mass-properties of the colliders** attached to it. There are two
ways to define the mass-properties of a collider:
1. The **easiest, automatic, way**: by giving the collider a non-zero density (the default density is 1.0) or a non-zero
   mass. This will make sure the other mass-properties like the angular inertia tensor are computed automatically from
   the collider's shape.
2. The **manual way**: by giving an explicit mass and angular inertia to the collider.

It is recommended to use the density-based or mass-based approaches as it will ensure the automatically-computed
mass-properties are coherent with the geometric shape. Wrong mass-properties (especially the angular inertia part and
center-of-mass location) may lead to odd behaviors. The manual approach is usually useful when modeling real-world
objects for which you already know the real-world mass, center-of-mass, and angular inertia tensor.

The mass-properties of a collider can only be set when the collider is created:
