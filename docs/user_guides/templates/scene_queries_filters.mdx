It is common to exclude some colliders from being considered by a scene query. For example, a ray-cast performed for a
character controller will usually want to skip the character itself. Sometimes, we may even want it to ignore both the
character and any collider attached to a dynamic rigid-body, and ignore all sensors. To allow this filtering, most
scene queries take <notjs>a `QueryFilter` argument that lets you describe what needs to be excluded. In particular
its fields:</notjs><js>several optional arguments that lets you describe what needs to be excluded. In particular, the
arguments:</js>
- `flags` allows you to discard whole families of colliders based on their types or their parent types (e.g. exclude all
  sensors and all the colliders attached to a dynamic rigid-body).
- `groups` is used to apply the [collision group](colliders#collision-groups-and-solver-groups) rules for the scene query.
  The scene query will only consider hits with colliders with collision groups compatible with this  collision group
  (using the bitwise test described in the [collision groups section](colliders#collision-groups-and-solver-groups)).
- `exclude_collider` is the handle of one collider the query must ignore.
- `exclude_rigid_body` is the handle of one rigid-body with attached colliders the query must ignore.
- `predicate` is a user-defined closure to apply any filtering rule. This can be used if the other filtering options
  above are not flexible enough.

Here is an an example of usage of the query filters with ray-casting:

<rapier>

```rust
let ray = Ray::new(point![1.0, 2.0], vector![0.0, 1.0]);
let max_toi = 4.0;
let solid = true;
let filter = QueryFilter::exclude_dynamic()
    .exclude_sensors()
    .exclude_rigid_body(player_handle)
    .groups(InteractionGroups::new(0b0011, 0b0001))
    .predicate(&|handle, collider| collider.user_data == 10);

if let Some((handle, toi)) = query_pipeline.cast_ray(
    &collider_set, &ray, max_toi, solid, filter
) {
    // Handle the hit.
}
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
/* Cast a ray inside of a system. */
fn cast_ray(rapier_context: Res<RapierContext>) {
    let ray_pos = Vec2::new(1.0, 2.0);
    let ray_dir = Vec2::new(0.0, 1.0);
    let max_toi = 4.0;
    let solid = true;
    let filter = QueryFilter::exclude_dynamic()
        .exclude_sensors()
        .exclude_rigid_body(player_handle)
        .groups(InteractionGroups::new(0b0011, 0b0001))
        .predicate(&|handle, collider| collider.user_data == 10);

    if let Some((entity, toi)) = rapier_context.cast_ray(
        ray_pos, ray_dir, max_toi, solid, filter
    ) {
        // Handle the hit.
    }
}
```

<js>

```js
let ray = new RAPIER.Ray({ x: 1.0, y: 2.0 }, { x: 0.0, y: 1.0 });
let maxToi = 4.0;
let solid = true;

let filterFlags = QueryFilterFlags.EXCLUDE_DYNAMIC,
let filterGroups = 0x000b0001,
let filterExcludeRigidBody = player_rigid_body,
let filterPredicate = (collider: Collider) => collider.userData == 10.0,


let hit = world.castRay(ray, maxToi, solid, filterFlags, filterGroups, null, filterExcludeRigidBody, filterPredicate);
if (hit != null) {
    // Handle the hit.
}
```
