This page describes <rapier> all the data structures needed for stepping the simulation as illustrated by the
[basic simulation example](getting_started#basic-simulation-example)</rapier><bevy> all the useful
resources added automatically by the `RapierPhysicsPlugin`</bevy>.


## Gravity
Gravity is represented as a vector. It affects every dynamic rigid-body taking part of the simulation. The gravity
can be altered at each timestep <rapier>(by passing a different vector to `PhysicsPipeline::step`)</rapier><bevy>(by
modifying the resource field `RapierConfiguration::gravity`)</bevy>.
Learn more about per-rigid-body gravity modification in [the dedicated section](rigid_bodies#gravity).

## Integration parameters
The `IntegrationParameters` <bevy>resource</bevy> controls various aspects of the physics simulation, including the timestep length,
number of solver iterations, number of CCD substeps, etc. The default integration parameters are set to
achieve a good balance between performance and accuracy for games. They can be changed to make the simulation more
accurate at the expanse of a bit of performance. Learn more about each integration parameter in
[the API docs](https://docs.rs/rapier3d/latest/rapier3d/dynamics/struct.IntegrationParameters.html).

## Island manager
The `IslandManager` <bevy>resource</bevy> is responsible for tracking the set of dynamic rigid-bodies that are still moving
and these that are no longer moving (and can ignored by subsequent timesteps to avoid useless computations).
The island manager is automatically updated by `PhysicsPipeline::step` and can be queried to retrieve
the list of all the rigid-bodies modified by the physics engine during the last timestep. This can be useful
to update the rendering of only the rigid-bodies that moved:

<rapier>

```rust
// Iter on each dynamic rigid-bodies that moved.
for rigid_body_handle in island_manager.active_dynamic_bodies() {
    let rigid_body = &rigid_body_set[*rigid_body_handle];
    println!("Rigid body {:?} has a new position: {}", rigid_body_handle, rigid_body.position());
}
```

</rapier>
<bevy>

```rust
fn print_active_bodies_positions(island_manager: Res<IslandManager>, positions: Query<&RigidBodyPositionComponent>) {
    // Iter on each dynamic rigid-bodies that moved.
    for rigid_body_handle in island_manager.active_dynamic_bodies() {
        if let Ok(rb_pos) = positions.get(rigid_body_handle.entity()) {
            println!("Rigid body {:?} has a new position: {}", rigid_body_handle, rb_pos.position);
        }
    }
}
```

</bevy>

Learn more about sleeping rigid-bodies in [the dedicated section](rigid_bodies#sleeping).

## Physics pipeline
The `PhysicsPipeline` <bevy>resource</bevy> is responsible for tying everything together in order to run the physics simulation.
It will take care of updating every data-structures mentioned in this page (except the other pipelines), running the collision-detection,
running the force computation and integration, and running CCD resolution.
<rapier>

`PhysicsPipeline::step` executes one timestep.
Its usage is illustrated in [the basic simulation example](getting_started#basic-simulation-example).

</rapier>

## Collision pipeline
The `CollisionPipeline` is similar to the `PhysicsPipeline` except that it will only run collision-detection.
It won't perform any dynamics (force computation, integration, CCD, etc.) It is generally used instead of
the `PhysicsPipeline` when one only needs collision-detection.

:::info
Running both the `CollisionPipeline` and the `PhysicsPipeline` is useless because the `PhysicsPipeline` already
does collision-detection.
:::


## Query pipeline
The `QueryPipeline` is responsible for efficiently running [scene queries](scene_queries), e.g., ray-casting,
shape-casting (sweep tests), intersection tests, on all the colliders of the scene.

<rapier>
Before it is used, the `QueryPipeline` needs to be updated in order to take the new colliders' positions into account.
The `QueryPipeline` can be used alone, but it is very common to use the `QueryPipeline` alongside the `CollisionPipeline`
or `PhysicsPipeline`:

```rust
// Game loop.
loop {
  physics_pipeline.step(...);
  query_pipeline.update(...);
  // Now we can read the results of the physics simulation,
  // and we can do advanced scene queries on the colliders.
}
```

</rapier>

Learn more about scene queries with the `QueryPipeline` in the [dedicated page](scene_queries).

## Rigid-body set
The `RigidBodySet` contains all the **rigid-bodies** that needs to be simulated. This set is represented as a
generational-arena, i.e., a vector where each element is indexed using a __handle__ that combines
an `u32` index and an `u32` generation number. This ensures that every rigid-body is given a unique handle.
Learn more about rigid-bodies in [the dedicated page](rigid_bodies).

## Collider set
The `ColliderSet` contains all the **colliders** that needs to be simulated. This set is represented as a
generational-arena, i.e., a vector where each element is indexed using a __handle__ that combines
an `u32` index and an `u32` generation number. This ensures that every collider is
given a unique handle.
Learn more about colliders in [the dedicated page](colliders).

## Joint set
The `ImpulseJointSet` contains all the **impulse-based joints** that needs to be simulated. This set is represented as a
generational-arena, i.e., a vector where each element is indexed using a __handle__ that combines
an `u32` index and an `u32` generation number. This ensures that every joint is
given a unique handle.
Learn more about joints in [the dedicated page](joints).

</rapier>

## CCD solver
The CCD solver <bevy>resource</bevy> is responsible for the resolution of Continuous-Collision-Detection. By itself, this structure
doesn't expose any feature useful. So it should simply be passed to the `PhysicsPipeline::step` method.
Learn more about CCD in [the dedicated section](rigid_bodies#continuous-collision-detection).

## Physics hooks
The physics hooks are trait-objects implementing the `PhysicsHooks` trait. They can be used to apply arbitrary
rules to ignore collision detection between some pairs of colliders. They can also be used to modify the contacts
processed by the constraints solver for computing forces.
Learn more about physics hooks in [the dedicated section](advanced_collision_detection#physics-hooks).


## Event handler
The event handlers are trait-objects implementing the `EventHandler` trait. They can be used to get notified
when two non-sensor colliders start/stop having contacts, and when one sensor collider and one other collider
start/stop intersecting. Learn more about collision events in
[the dedicated section](advanced_collision_detection#collision-and-contact-force-events).
